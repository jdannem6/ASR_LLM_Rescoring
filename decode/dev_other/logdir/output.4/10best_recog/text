4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSION APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN COMBINATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMON HAD BOATED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SOLDER
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF ARABIN STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT AND RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM RIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNLIKEFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHICH IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 ONE HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDING TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAVE BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDESTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WHEELS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER IN RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS RAIN FOR EVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD FLUSHED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON IN ITS AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 GRACE AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRIES WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LAWREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO AND PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 HENRY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER IN MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERAL SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LORRYIN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOUR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOU JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BETTER WILL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE TO DELAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMEND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METRIPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONSULTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE HIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONES
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE SQUARE PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICE
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIDES I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO IN EFFECTUAL ATTENDANTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY AWAY

4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WOULD WHICH SHOULD LIKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULLY FULFILL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO ACKNOWLEDGE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SOLID EYES HE GALLIED WITH THE GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHUMS STEPPED BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT ROLE ATTACHMENT

4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL HE LET HER ENGAGEMENT LOST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT HAVE MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO BE CHARVISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNED MIST
4515-11057-0101 JUST THE DELAY THE MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY

4515-11057-0105 GOOD BOY SHE GOT HIM HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THAT MARIAN LEFT THE SHOUT OF THE TREE OPPOSITE HER OF DRILLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF THE MAN WHO WAS SUFFERING A SOVIIA HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTERS GAVE VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNIZED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TIMES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PERTAIN TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT HE WAS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL HANDSOME A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT SURELY YOU NEED NOT FRESH TRUTH HOW AWFULLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU'RE THE ARTLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SAKES AND I COULD NOT BE ABLE TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PAST BEFORE THEY CAME OF REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL WE BOTHAISE ABOUT YOURSELF I BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD BEEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CABINET WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRECICABLE WITH IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LION AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUN POWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER BRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIVE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LATE WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW BESATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 A QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE A PARTY TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER A MATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO A DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARIER AND THE FOX HUNG VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES AS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LIE DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOUR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 THAT COPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE CAPTAIN REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HAND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND PLAWS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAKLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WEALTH SOUTHERN OR OUTER HAND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WE FALSE ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BREAD BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARIOR AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBORO HAM SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
4570-14911-0008 THERE THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHASTEN THEY HOUSEED PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HALTING THE LEE PARK THE STOKE PLACE THE EDEMBOURG THE SERBITTON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODDAYIL MISSUS G W J HILLIARDS MISSUS PRICES AND MISSUS TURNERS
4570-14911-0010 EYES BROWN DARK MAZLE OR HAZEL NOT DEEP SET NOR BULGY AND WITH A MILD EXPRESSION
4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LO FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHEEK
4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DEW BATH
4570-14911-0013 SHOULDERS GREEN AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING
4570-14911-0014 FOUR LOOKS QUITE STRAIGHT WHILE UNDER THE DOG OF GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND IN THE BONE
4570-14911-0015 FEET ROUND WELL NNUCKLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED
4570-14911-0016 COAT SMOOTH VARIETY SMOOTH GRAY DANCE AND NOT TOO FINE OR SHORT
4570-14911-0017 HUT NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE EACH COLONEL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAD ATTRIBUTE
4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THESE SAME ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT
4570-24733-0002 CAN ITS NATURE INFINITE
4570-24733-0003 MUST NECESSARY EXIST
4570-24733-0004 WE HAVE NOW CREDITED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTEING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSECUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS
4570-24733-0005 AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED FOR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD DEFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THERE FROM
4570-24733-0006 BARE IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANY THING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE
4570-24733-0007 COROLLARY HANDS IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN'S CALASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS AS SUNDAY RAM
4570-24733-0008 COLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER
