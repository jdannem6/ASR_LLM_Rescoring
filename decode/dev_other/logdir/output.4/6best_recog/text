4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSION APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMON HAD VOTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SOLDER
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAMEN STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMEND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARK SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM RIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINEFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD BEGIN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 ONE HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED INTO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WOULD HAVE BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WHALES OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRITS PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER IN RAMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOR EVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLINTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALTERED IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON IN ITS AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 GRACE AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRIES WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LAWRIAN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO AND PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 MARY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER IN MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERAL SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I SHALL BE GUIDED BY YOUR JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGES THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE TO DISPLAY AT SUCH TIME BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH A RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A MATROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURAL EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MAN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALUTES
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUICK PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICE
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE ASSEMBLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO IN EFFECTUAL ATTACKS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY AWAY

4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LONG
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WOOD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILLE
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MIGHT HIM TOO IGNIABLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SOLID DIES HE GALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHUMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT ROUL ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WALKED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGIONS PARK

4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET HER ENGAGEMENT LOST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT HAVING MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO BE CHARGEISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMN OF MIST
4515-11057-0101 JUST THE DELIGHT IN MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY
4515-11057-0102 AM YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARION YOU GOD WORK
4515-11057-0104 THEY MUST AND I HAVE NO CHARM TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BY SHE GAVE HIM HER HEAD
4515-11057-0106 I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THAT MARION LEFT THE SHOUT OF THE TREE I OPENED HER OF DRILLLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF THE MAN WHO WAS SUFFERING A SOPHIA HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER GAVE VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNIZED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TIMES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST EFFECTION BUT HE WAS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YES THAT MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THY SURELY YOU NEED NOT A FRESH PROOF HOW AWFULLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU'RE THE ODDLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BE ABLE TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVEN DAYS PASSED BEFORE THEY CAME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL WE BOTHISE ABOUT YOURSELF I BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBABLE
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRCICABLE WITH IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINES AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 THE INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUN POWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY PARLIAMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LEAST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDNCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITOR'S WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 A QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE PARTY TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURE THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IN MATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO A DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HEREIER AND THE FOX FOUND VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARIORS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FASHIONED RULE AS TO COLOR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT PAPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE CAPTAIN REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HAND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND PHIWS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE THING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WEALTH SOUTHERN OR OUTER HAND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A FALSE ROUGH COATED BEE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BREAD BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HAIRIOR AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBORO HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEN TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHASTEN THEY HOUSE DID PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HALTING THE LEE PARK THE STOKE PLACE THE EDEMBOURG THE SERBITTON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODDAYIL MISSUS G W J HILLIARDS MISSUS PRICES AND MISSUS TURNERS

4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINDING TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHEEK
4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DEW BAT
4570-14911-0013 SHOULDERS CLEAR AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING
4570-14911-0014 FOR LOOKS QUITE STRAIGHT WHILE UNDER THE DOG OF GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND AND THE BONE
4570-14911-0015 FEET ROUND WELL KUCKLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED
4570-14911-0016 COAT SMOOTH VARIETY SMOOTH VERY DANCE AND NOT TO FINE OR SHORT
4570-14911-0017 HOT NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE EACH COLONEL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAID ATTRIBUTE
4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT
4570-24733-0002 IN ITS NATURE INFANT
4570-24733-0003 THUS NECESSARILY EXIST
4570-24733-0004 WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTEING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONCENTUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS
4570-24733-0005 AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED FOR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT FOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THERE FROM
4570-24733-0006 BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME COMPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE
4570-24733-0007 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN'S CALASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS AS SUNDAY RRAM
4570-24733-0008 COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS ARE THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER
