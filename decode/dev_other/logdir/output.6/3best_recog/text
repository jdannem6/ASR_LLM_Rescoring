6599-38591-0012 THE DAINTIES PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ASSESION
6841-88291-0000 THE SINCEOR EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED BEAUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DRAW BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GATE AMONG THE APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LINE WITH FOUR DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARG MOTIONLESS CANVASS EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE VELVET OF CATTLE AND THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOW BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMOVOTA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAIGHT HERD FROM THE CORRALES TO GOOD FEED THREE BREAD AND CRUISER TOLD TO BRAND THE CALS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO A FOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CROWNS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AS DISTANCE
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREECE WOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILD ON A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WILD GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A CHIEF OF LONG JA AGE STEP AND IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE PINS SMOKE AT CIGARETTES AND CHATTTEN TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SIGNED ACROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN AN OLD CAVALCANTI JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE GROUP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOME WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE WITH THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIDEN LION AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CAF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEADS SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULLDOGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNC UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLUPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 GUESS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIVER TOO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS NECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YIELD ONE OF THE BULL DOGGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKER HE HELD THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRAND IMPRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLEED A LITTLE LESS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUE PELLIN AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLES ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANNING
