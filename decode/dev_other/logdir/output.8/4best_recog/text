7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS EXAMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THE HERACLEES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THELAND WORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADVANCED COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGED BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WANT HER FROM AN ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID OUR MEDICINE I'VE HAD PAINS ENOUGH
7641-96684-0038 THEN AT MEDTRS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT HOME TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AND A DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO NOT VISITED TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTEN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN AT THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND EM ON MY WAY TO MONSSION

7697-105815-0004 HE STWED AS IF HE WOULD FLEE FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HOME NEAR HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT THUS ITS MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THESE
7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SOUGHT MAID COMING TO LAY TO DUST SO HE SEEMED ME CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HE SLOPES LAY FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TUBE WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THOSE AND WEPT LOW THREE BROUGHT ONES CAMPAIGN AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THINE SCENES
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTEN GAVE FREE LEAVES FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLAYS AS BEAST BLAST CROWDS BEST TOO
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VEIL WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTEN SIRS LET'S CALL YOU AND WHERE DO GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MANIST AND HIPPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN DELAND THE PLAIN GLORY AND OUR ON OUR WAY TO MOUNTSIGN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOWING NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR WOULD CLIMB SEPT TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEVE
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG YEARS HAD MADE A LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAPPENED SILVER YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID HE NO DOUBT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE OATHS
7697-105815-0019 NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TO THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HEEL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DREAMED OF IT AND THEN WENT UP FEW
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALFWAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HUE AND THOSE WHO CAME BY MY REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMUROUS SAT THE DESIGN WAS FOR HIM THEY MEANT TO CALL BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORTISH SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THEY LAY TWO BEATS OF PREYING OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SNAPPED HER LOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL IN US AND TO OUR WINGS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FOUND IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS CROW THAT HE MIGHT READ IT IN FIND SOME PIECE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUNDED NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FOUND DAWN ON HIS KNEES TO BREATHE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL BESAT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 HO FOR THAT I AM SAID TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO HE GAVE WAY TO THE FLASHES TO USE FOR YEAS THAT REST WHICH LORD OF FOR YOU HAD MADE BUT FORT HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LAW OF THE JEWS FOR THEY SEEM THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RATCY AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROT WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 SO FAR AND I HALF BEING ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE BAY ONCE MORE WHERE A FORCE FELL HE SAID DYING WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SET GLANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCREW WHICH HE CAUGHT IT WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BY HIS ROBE
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID ENOUGH IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GO
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT ACT DID HE NOW CLAM THE HUE
7697-105815-0035 HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEATS RANCHING THE KNOT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DART HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MEN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HELP AS IF HE WOULD DO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAT IS BY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT IN THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT EAR TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MEAST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS THEY HEARD THEM ROAR IF THEY DID PAY NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEN HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LOT WHERE A WATCHFUL DOUBT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SO WHAT HEALTH OF THIS MEN ARE RUSH HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFALL TOLD HER WHY QUESTION HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH HIM TO HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 HEIGHTY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS AS TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU A FOOL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ALL YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WAS A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAY SHOULD WISH STILL MUST GO TO MAN THINE
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DRAW WITH SUCH AS NOT THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY NO WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 THOUGH THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HALF ME LEAVE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TO A BRAVE DAY AND THEN HE SAT AT HIM
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASK WITH WHICH SENTENCED TO SUCH REFUSED AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DEBAT SLEW GANIAH OF DEATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS MAN SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WILL SEE MAN WHOSE LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEING HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHERE I NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JOE THOU JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STUPID LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THOSE YOU SAVE US MAN WHO HAST MADE SUCH A STORY NOW AT TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE MUST HE'S LACK FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS BATH THE TROUBLE SAME WAY WAS CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HOMEFUL SECRETION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO WE SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HATE CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I AGREED THAT I HATH BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR HOW GOOD
7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW STAND US LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SUCH TRYING DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAKING HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU'D LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FAULT
7697-105817-0011 AND BY BESACKED WE CURED OUR SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MEN WOULD HAVE BE MASTER OR MAN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISBAD HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SUDDENLY DISAPPROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW IS GOVERNS AND FEAR WERE THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 CERTAINLY DIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAID IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSE SO
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE A OBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS GROUP TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HER AND THIS COME HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THEIR REASON EXCEPT IT FROM THE MASTERSHIP OR GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAIN ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET AT THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN COURT AS IN THE PRESENCE DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS A BAYING
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WAS SEEM THAT ANALYSIS MAY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE A BIT MEN IN THE STATE OF MEDICINES
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FITTING THE STATE OF HIM SINCE MAN HAS NOT BEEN AND OVERPENS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MAY REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUADITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSATIVE SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HATH BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNITY HAVE BEEN STAROW
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUT THE DISPERITY
7697-245712-0016 AN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS BOTH DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTIVE NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A MISTAKE OF MEDICINES MAY NOT HAPPY MASKED OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF EXISTENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY COT OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREEMEN CAN BE CUT A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF MINUTES BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF MEDICINES THEY WOULD HAVE BE NONICIPAL AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IN FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE SIGNIFICENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAPPEN IN PERFECT IN BODY SCIENCE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF MEDICINES THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S COURSE AS IN GENERATION WITH HAPPY IN COMMONY WITH MATTER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VANBRAST IS IN PRISON FORGET I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HOPELESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LOVED ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAMED THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE OFFENSIVE AND PERHAPS STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN ENLIST ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOUT ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE

8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE SHOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD PROUD SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MIGHT

8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FROM MY FOOD IN SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LOFTFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD

8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR LIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMEN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD IN THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDIST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY

8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS IN VATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVE ME I SAID

8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WELL SENSE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DOUBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOURWORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENDS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE EMPEROR A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
