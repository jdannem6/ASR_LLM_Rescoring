7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THE SAMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THE HERACLEES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF LAND WORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND MENACE COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID OUR MEADOWS I'VE HAD PAINS ENOUGH
7641-96684-0038 THEN AT MUTTERS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT DOWN TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AND A DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO NOT VISITED TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 QUESTION I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN AT THE HOUSE

7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOTHEST MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MEN TO SWEEP IT

7697-105815-0008 THEY YOUR NEXT SOUGHT MAID COMING TO LAY TO DUST SO HE SEEMED MI CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS SLOPES LAY FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LOW THREE BROUGHT ONES CAMPAIGN AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THINE SCENES
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTEN GAVE FREE LEAVES FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLAYS AS GOOSE BLAST CROWDS BLESS TOO
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT TOM THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VEIL WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN THE SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTON SIRS LET'S CALL YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MANEST AND HIPPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN DELAND THE FINE GLORY AND OUR ON OUR WAY TO MOUNTSIGN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 NOR YOU'D NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR WOULD COME SET TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEVE
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE A LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAPPENED SILVER YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID SHE NO DOUBT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE EARTH
7697-105815-0019 IS NONE OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ONTO THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HEEL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS A SPRING OF LIFE HE DREAMED OF IT AND THEN WENT UP FEW
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HUGH AND THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMUROUS SAT THE DESIGN WAS FOR YOU THEY MEANT TO CLOUD BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORTISHED SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THEY LAY TO BEATS OF PREYING OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SNAPPED HER LOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL IN US AND TO OUR WINGS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS THROAT THAT HE MIGHT READ IT IN FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR EIGHT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FOUND DAWN ON HIS KNEES TO BREATHE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL BEACT AND THEN WHEN BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 HO FOR THAT I AM SAID TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO HE GAVE WAY TO THE FLASH AS TO USE FOR YEASE THAT REST WHICH LORD OF FOR YOU HAD MADE BUT FORT HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LAW OF THE JEWS FOR THEY SEEN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF UGRASSE AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TRIED WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEVE
7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR WHEN I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAVE COME TO THE BAY ONCE MORE WHERE A FORCE FELL HE SAID DYING WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SET GLANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCREW WHICH HE CAUGHT IT WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT TO HIS ROBE
7697-105815-0033 HE LAY ENOUGH IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOT
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LAST ACT DID HE NOW CLAM THE HUE
7697-105815-0035 HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEATS SPRENDING THE KNOT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MEN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HELP AS IF HE WOULD DO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAT IS BY STRAND SO POOR
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT IN THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHANGE AND ARE PUT EAR TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MEST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS THEY HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID PAY NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEN HE WENT HOME WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LOT WHERE A WATCHFUL DOUBT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SO WHAT HEALTHED THIS MEN ARE RUSHED HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFALL TOLD HER WHY QUESTION HATH COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BEEN DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN TWO HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 TITY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS AS TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU A FOOL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WAS A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM YET THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAY SHOULD WISH TILL MUST GO TO MONT THINE
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS KNIGHT THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU WIFE AND BATHES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 THAT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HALF ME LEAVE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TO IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS TO PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TO A BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SAT AT HIM
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASK WITH WHICH SENTENCED TO SUCH REFUSED AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DABBET SLEW GANIUS OF DEATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAD SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WILL SEE MAN HIS LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEING HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD OR NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JOE THOU JEST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STUPID LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THOSE YOU SAVE THIS MAN WHO HAST MADE SUCH A STURRY NOW AT TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE WHEN ENOUGH HE'S LACKED FOR THE TRUTH THE NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS BATH THE TREAD OF SAME WAY WAS CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HANDFUL SECRETION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO WE SAT OFF THROUGH TO FIELD
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HATE CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I WISH THAT I HATH BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR A GOOD
7697-105817-0008 QUESTION WE MUST NOW STAND US LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID TRYING DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAKING HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU'D LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS BE KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FAULT
7697-105817-0011 AND BY BESACK WE CURED OUR SOLS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BE MASTER OR REMAIN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF ELLISONS MEN HAVE NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISBADEEN THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SUDDENLY DISAPPROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW HIS GOVERNS AND FEAR WERE THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 CERTAINLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A POVERTY OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAID IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UVERSO
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE A OBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS BROKE TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OR ON THIS COME HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THEIR REASON EXCEPT IT FROM THE MASTERSHIP OR GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS REGAINED ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED AT THE ANIMAL TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN COURT AS IN THE PRESENCE DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS A BABYING
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT ANALYSIS MAY WOULD NOT HALF HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD I HAVE A BIT MEN IN THE STATE OF MEDICINES
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FITTING THE STATE OF HIM SINCE MAN HAD NOT BEEN AND OVERPENSE
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MEN REASON HAS POSITION OF MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUADITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HATH BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STAROW
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUTEDLY DISPERITY
7697-245712-0016 THE QUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTIVE NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A MISTAKE OF BUSINESS MAN WOULD NOT HAPPY MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF EXISTENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT A MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN OTHER SENSE MASSSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREEMEN CAN BE CUT A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF HAPPINESS BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS THEY WOULD HAVE BE NONICIPAL AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IN FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE SYNIFICENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAPPEN IN PERFECT IN BECOMING SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF MEDICINES THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S COURSE AS IN GENERATION WITH HAPPY IN COMMONY WITH MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VANBRANT IS IN PRESENT FORGET I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU COPLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY SHE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLEND THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE OFFENSIVE AND BRAMP STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN INTELLECT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY MANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY FOR ME SHE ASKED

8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN NEVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE ON MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MIND GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE CHARMING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AN YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE BRIDE AS A CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS LIFE

8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD IN SHOULDER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BYNS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BETTER AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK THE UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATIONS OF THE WORLD IN THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS OF STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 OH WHAT A MAN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF
8173-294714-0025 I GUILTED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORST SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAVE HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS IN FATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS ANDATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVE'N
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO DO YOUR ONLY FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVATEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY TELL ME BACK TO HEALTH

8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOU CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANCH
8173-294714-0036 DO YOU SPEAK OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY MEET YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR INXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRIP
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR AS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MAIN ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DATE
8173-294714-0043 THE SNOW THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE WARWORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENSE IN PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO REVERT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE ISABELLA A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY PHYSICIAN THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFERED TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY BUT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT

8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRAND OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SENSIBLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON A POLICY OF INSURANCE

8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHILE THE RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISSED ME SHE WHISPERED THE BEFORE YOU GO
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR KINDNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME

8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT OUR DECORATURE WITH SILKEN GOLD AND SILVER
