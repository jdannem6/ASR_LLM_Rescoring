7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THE HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE LAND WORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND GOODNESS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES

7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LOW THREE BROUGHT ONES CAMPAIGN AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST RACE FROM THINE SCENES
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTEN GAVE FREE LEAVES FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE AS GOOSE BLAST CROWDS BEST TOO
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VEIL WHERE HE SAW FREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIN SIRS LET'S CALL YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MANEST AND HPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN DELAND THE PLAIN GLORY AND OUR ON OUR WAY TO MOUNTSIGN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 NOR YOU'RE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR WOULD COME SET TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEVE
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THIS DOOR FOR LONG YEARS HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAPPENED SILVER YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DIED OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE LOTS
7697-105815-0019 IN NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HERE OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WHEN TOOK FEW
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HE AND THOSE WHO CAME BY MY REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMUROUS SAT THE DESIGN WAS FOR HIM THEY MEANT TO CLOUD BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORTISHED SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THEY LAY TO BEATS OF PREYING OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SNAPPED HER LOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL IN US AND TEAR OUR WINGS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FOUND IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS BROW THAT HE MIGHT READ IT IN FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 YOU FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FOUND DAWN ON HIS KNEES TO BREATHE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL BEAT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 OH FOR THAT I AM SAID TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO THEY GAVE WAY TO THE FLASHES TO USE FOR YEASE THAT REST WHICH LORD OF FOR YOU HAD MADE BUT FORT HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LAW OF THE JEWS FOR THEY SEEN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF DORATCY AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROT WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEVE
7697-105815-0030 SO FAR AND I HAVE BEING ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAVE COME TO THE BAY ONCE MORE WHERE FORCE FELL HE SAID DYING WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SET LANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCREW WHICH HE CAUGHT IT WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BACK HIS ROAD
7697-105815-0033 HE LAY ENOUGH IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LAST ACT DID HE NOW CLAMMED THE HUE
7697-105815-0035 HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEATS SPRANDING THE KNOT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DART HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MEN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HELP AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAT IS BY STRAND SO POOR
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT EAR TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH GNAW
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MEST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THUS STILL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS THEY HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID PAY NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEN HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LOT WHERE A WATCHFUL DOUBT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SO WHAT HEALTH OF THIS MEN WERE RUSHED HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFALL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME

7697-105815-0048 CHARITY YOU WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HALF ME LEAVE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS TO PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TO A BRIEF DAY AND THEN HE SAT AT HIM
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASK WITH WHICH SENTENCED TO SUCH REFUSE AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DABBET SLEW GANIUS OF DEATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LED SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WILL SEE MAN WHO LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEING HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHERE AM NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JUT THOU JEST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STUPID LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THOSE YOU SAVE THIS MAN WHO HAST MADE SUCH A STORY NOW IT TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE WHEN ENOUGH HE'S LACKED FOR THE TRUTH THE NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS BATH THE TRIBE OF SAME WAY WAS CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GO HELPFUL SECRETION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO WE SAT OFF THROUGH A FIELD
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HATE CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I BRIEF THAT I HATH BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR ALL GOOD
7697-105817-0008 PRUDENCE WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SET TRYING TO SPARE YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAKING HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FRONT
7697-105817-0011 AND BY BESET WE CURED OUR SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE THE MASTER OR MEN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INCENCE MEN HAVE NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD SPADE NOTHING DISBAD HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SUDDENLY DISAPPROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW WAS GOVERNOUS AND FEAR WITH THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 CERTAINLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MEN AND FATHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAINTED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE A SUGGESTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROOF TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OR AND THIS COME HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THEIR REASON EXCEPT IT FROM THE MASTERSHIP OR GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAIN ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOT LED AT THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN COURT AS IN THE PRESENT DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS A BABYING
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WAS SEEMED THAT ANALYSIS MAY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE A BIG MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FITTING THE STATE OF HIM SINCE MAN HAVE NOT BEEN AND OVERPENS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MY REASON HAS A POSITION OF MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUADITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSATIVE SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HATH BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HATH BEEN STARREL
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUT LITTLE DISPARITY
7697-245712-0016 IN A QUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTIVE NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A MISTAKE OF MEDICINE MAN WOULD NOT HAPPY MASKED OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MEN
7697-245712-0019 IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREEMEN CAN BE CUT A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF PHENOMENA BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF CITIZENS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN NONICIPAL AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IN FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE SYNIFICENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGUN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAPPEN IN PERFECT IN BARTHOLEMY SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S COURSE AS IN GENERATION WOULD HAPPEN IN COMMONY WITH MATTER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VANBANT IS IN PRISON FORGET I SAID
8173-294714-0001 IN I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HOPELESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME A LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CROWDORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE OFFENSIVE AND RAMP STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND START ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU THINK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASKED

8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN NEVER FORGET THE GREAT DESTRUCTION OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DALL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING BACK THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD BRIGHT SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS ONE
8173-294714-0016 A DOUBTLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND AND PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD IN CHILDREN
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LOSSFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 THAT AS HE IS HE IS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNDRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE PARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD IN THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT ROCKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 OH WHAT OR MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SAY OF IT
8173-294714-0025 I YIELD IT AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAVE HAD LEFT AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INBATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS ANATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGETN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR OLD FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE CHANCE FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAD BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DAUGHTER'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHASES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRAND
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEANS SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY DID YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERES NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETY
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN THROUGH
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSIT HE FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WELL SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO EXCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DECK
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOURWARDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL ATTEND AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO REVERT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE FERKO A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 TAKES TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY BUT HE WANTED ON AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKENLY REPLIED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BURNT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURENCE
8173-294714-0051 YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY

8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHLY UNEXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSIONED MYSELF HER DELICACY TOOK THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER VAN BROWNIE SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I COULD HONESTLY PUNISH THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE THE CORPSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHILE AN RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GALL
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWDERS ME
