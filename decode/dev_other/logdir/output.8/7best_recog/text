7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THE HERACLIUS COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF LAND WORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRING ONE WITH HIM

7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VEIL WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN THE SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS LET'S COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MADEST AND HIPPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN DELAND THE PLAIN GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNTSIGN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOWING NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR WOULD CLIMB SEPT TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON DESOLATE FOR LONG YEARS HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAPPENED SILVER YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID IT NO DOUBT OF IT

7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON DOING THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HEEL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS A SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP FEW
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HUE THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MY REST THERE

7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FOUND IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS THROAT THAT HE MIGHT READ IT IN FIND SOME PIECE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND HIM NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FOUND DAWN ON HIS KNEES TO BREATHE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL BE AT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 O FOR THAT I AM SAID TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO HE GAVE WAY TO THE FLASHES TO USE FOR YEAS THAT REST WHICH LORD OF FOR YOU HAD MADE BUT FORT HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LAW OF THE JEWS FOR THEY SEEM THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF UGRASSE AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROT WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 SO FAR WHEN I HAVE BEING ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HA COME TO THE BAY ONCE MORE WHERE FORCE FELL HE SAID DYING WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SET GLANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCREW WHICH HE CAUGHT IT WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BACK HIS ROW
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID ENOUGH IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO THAT
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIE DAT DID HE NOW CLAM THE HUE
7697-105815-0035 HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEATS SPRENDING THE KNOT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DART HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MEN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THE CHRISTIAN MADE HELP AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAT IS BY STRAND SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHANGE AND ARE PUT EAR TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH LONG
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THUS STILL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS THEY HEARD THEM ROAR IF THEY DID PAY NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LOT WHERE A WATCHFUL DOUBT

7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS TO PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TO A BRAVE DAY AND THEN HE SAT AT HIM
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASK WITH WHICH SENTENCED TO SUCH REFUSE AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DABBET SLEW GANIATH OF DEATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LEAD SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WILL SEE MENUS LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEING HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD FOR I NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JET THOU JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STOOP LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THOSE YOU SAVE US MAN WHO HAST MADE SUCH A STORY NARROW TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE MUST HE'S LACK FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS BATH THE TRIBE OF SAME WAY WAS CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HOPEDFUL SECRETION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO HE SAT OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HATE CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I BRE THAT I HATH BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IN US FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 CUSHION WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SUCH TRYING TO SPARE YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAKING HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU'D LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FOUGHT
7697-105817-0011 AND BY BESACKC WE CURED OUR SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BE MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNICENCE MEN HAVE NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD IT SPADE NOTHING DISBAD HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SUDDENLY DISAPPROVE BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW WAS GOVERNS AND FEAR WITH THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 CERTAINLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MEN AND MOTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAID IN IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSE SO
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE A DEJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OR AND THIS COME HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THEIR REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OR GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAIN ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED AT THE UTMOST TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ENEMIES WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN COURT AS IN THE PRESENT DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEYING
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT ANALYSIS MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD I HAVE A BIT MEN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FITTING THE STATE OFOM SINCE MAN HAS NOT BEEN AND OVERPENS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MAY REASON HAS THE POSITION OF MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUADITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSATIVE SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HATH BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STARREL
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUT IT IN DISPARITY
7697-245712-0016 A QUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTIVE NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A MISTAKE OF BUSINESS MAN WOULD NOT HAPPY MASKED OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF AMUSEMENT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CUT A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF MEDICINE BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INCIDENTS THEY WOULD HAVE BE NONICIPAL AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED AND FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE SIGNIFICENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAPPEN IN PERFECT IN BEAUTY SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S COURSE AS IN GENERATION WITH HAPPENING COMMONY WITH MATTER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VANBANK IS IN PRISON FORGET I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LOST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HOPELESS

8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE OFFENSIVE AND BRANCH STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN AFFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STRUCK ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY AS TO ME SHE ASKED

8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MIND GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DALL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD EXHIBITS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD RIGHT SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 AND SUCH A POSITION AS MINE
8173-294714-0016 A HOWLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND AND PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOT IN SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT DINS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 THAT AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATE FULL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE AND THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD IN THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREET WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 NO WHAT A MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU SO CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPEAK OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WERE SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAVE HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INACTUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS IN THATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVE ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET MEAN DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN

8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VANBRAND
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEATHS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY MEANS YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETYS
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TREE
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HE GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD KNOWN ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS RESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENDED PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE GENZABURO A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION BUT ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED IN AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN SHE REPLIED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VANPART OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO MORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SILENTLY
8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY WARRIORS
8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUST WHEREY UNEXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED HERSELF HER DELICACY TOOK THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER THEN BRANCH SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I COULD ARTISTLY PROMISE THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE A COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHEN MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GOT
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWRES ME
8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISCRUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING A SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION ON THAT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBOED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME TO GRANDMOTHER AND HER DULY DECK A SUIT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SOME BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES

8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THE GOING TO SCHOOL SAID CALLER AS THE OXEN PLOTTED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS WERE THEM QUITE WILD
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SEEING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEAMS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS

8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORD HAS SO MANY BEGGARS AS INDIA
8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WON TO EXPLORE A GARDEN NEAR THEM
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THEY'RE DOGS SAID NORHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS AND THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CAME DOWN BY A STREAM

8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDUS AND DO NOT KILL OR ENDURE WEN FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ONE AGAIN THEY SAW GREEN CLOUD OF DUSTS ON THE ROAD

8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT OUR DECORATURE WITH SILK AND GOLD AND SILVER
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WHAT WAS A HOLLOW WHICH IS LIKE A BIG CHAIR OF THE CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LIGHT WAS THE RODJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COD SUCKS AND JEWELS THE GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOW DUST DID A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA A FINE FETHERS OVER THE REDDAS'S HEAD

8254-115543-0026 IS IN IT FINE DRYLE DOWN A BIG ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE SALT TALKED IN NOTHING WITH A GREAT REJOINOUS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS A BARGAINING FOR FOOD AND A LITTLE BOAT
