7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THE HERACLIUS COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THELAND WORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADDRESS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES

7641-96684-0038 THEN AT MEDDRS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT HOME TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AND A DOOR WITH WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK VISITED TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE A GOOD MAN AT THE HOUSE

7697-105815-0004 HE STOOED AS IF HE WOULD FLEE FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HOME NEAR HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK INTO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTEN WHAT MEANS THESE
7697-105815-0008 THERE NEXT SOUGHT MAID COMING TO LAY TO DUST SO HE SEEMED ME CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS A SLOPE SAVE FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TUBE WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THOSE AND WEPT LOW THREE BROUGHT ONES CAMPAIGN AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST RACE FROM THINE SCENES
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTEN GAVE FREE LEAVES FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLAYS AS THIS BLAST CROWDS BEST TOO
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT HOME THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VEIL WHERE HE SAW FREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTEN SIRS LET'S CALL YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MADEST AND HIPPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN DELAND THE PLAIN GLORY AND OUR ON OUR WAY TO MOUNTSIGN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOWING NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR WOULD COME SET TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON BEST DOOR FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAPPENED SILVER YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DAUGHTER OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE OUTS
7697-105815-0019 'S NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON DO THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HEEL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP FEW
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HUE AND THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMUROUS SAT THE DESIGN WAS FOR HIM THEY MEANT TO CLOUD BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORTISH SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THEY LAY TWO BEATS OF PREYING OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SNAPPED HER LOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL IN US AND TEAR OUR WINGS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FOUND IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS THROAT THAT HE MIGHT READ IT IN FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FEEL FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FOUND DAWN ON HIS KNEES TO BREATHE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL BESIDES AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 O FOR THAT I AM SAID TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO HE GAVE WAY TO THE FLASHES TO USE FOR YEASE THAT REST WHICH LORD OF FOR YOU HAD MADE BUT FORT HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LAW OF THE JEWS FOR THEY SEEN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF UGRASSE AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TRIED WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 SO FAR WHEN I HALF BEING ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE BAY ONCE MORE WHERE FORCE FELL HE SAID DYING WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SET LANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCREW WHICH HE CAUGHT IT WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BACK HIS ROBE
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID ENOUGH IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOT
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LAST ACT DID HE NOW CLEAN THE HUE
7697-105815-0035 HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEATS RENDING THE KNOT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MEN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HELP AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAT IS BY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHANGE AND ARE PUT EAR TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE LEAST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THUS STILL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS THEY HEARD THEM ROAR IF THEY DID PAY NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEN HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LOT WHERE A WATCHFUL DOUBT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HEALTH OF THIS MEN ARE RUSHED HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME

7697-105815-0043 HIDY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS AS TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU A FOOL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTEN WAS A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT SHE SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAY SHOULD WISH TILL MUST GO TO MAN THINE
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL GO WITH SUCH AS NOT THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY NOR WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TO BRAVE A DAY AND THEN HE SAT AT HIM
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASK WITH WHICH SENTENCED TO SUCH REFUSE AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DABBET SLEW GANIAH OF DEATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LEG SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WILL SEE MASTER'S LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEING HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD OR ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JOE THOU JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STOOP LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THOSE YOU SAVE THIS MAN WHO HAST MADE SUCH A STORY NARROW TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE MUST HE'S LACK FOR THE TRUTH THE NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS BATH THE TROUBLE SAME WAY WAS CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HOPEFUL SECRETION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SAT OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HATE CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I AGREE THAT I HATH BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOODS
7697-105817-0008 QUESTION WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SET TRYING DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAKING HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU'D LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN THOUGHT
7697-105817-0011 AND BY BESACK WE CURED OUR SOS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BE MASTER OR MEN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF MEDICINES MEN HAVE NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD SPADE NOTHING DISBADE HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SUDDENLY DISAPPROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW WAS GOVERNS AND FEAR WITH THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 CERTAINLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAID IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE A SUGGESTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER AND THIS COME HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THEIR REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OR GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAIN ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET IT THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN COURT AS IN THE PRESENCE DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEYING
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A SABONISM MAY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE A BIT MEN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FITTING THE STATE OF THEM SINCE MAN HAD NOT BEEN AND OVERPENS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUADITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSATIVE SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HATH BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STAROW
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUT A DISPERITY
7697-245712-0016 IN A QUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS BOTH DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTIVE NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A MISTAKE OF MEDICINES MAN WOULD NOT HAPPY MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF ABSENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREEMEN CAN BE CUT A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF THENESS BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF THINGS THEY WOULD HAVE BE NONICIPAL AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED AND FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE SIGNIFICENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAPPEN IN PERFECT EMBODIED SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S COURSE AS IN GENERATION WITH HAPPY IN COMMONY WITH MATTER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VANBAND IS IN PRISON FORGET I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS RESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE PROPERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE OFFENSIVE AND BRAND STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN INSIST ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOP ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO COOLLY TO ME SHE ASKED

8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD EXCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD PRAY SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MIND
8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH THE MOCK HUSBAND AND PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BUYNS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BUT AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK BE UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO CAN DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD IN THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS HIS STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 NO WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU THINK OF IT
8173-294714-0025 I YELLED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORDS SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAVE HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME OBSERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR OWN FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVANTLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELD ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO THE DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 THE DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VANBRANDT
8173-294714-0036 DO YOU SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY MADE YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOURXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUE
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR IS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WELL SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEATH
8173-294714-0043 THE SNEER THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOURWORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENT AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE FERKO A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THINKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN THEY REPLIED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN GRANT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BAR MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID LOUDLY
8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYERS
8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUST WORTHY UNEXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF HER DELICACY TO THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER VANANCE SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I COULD EARNESTLY PROMISE THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE OF COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I AROSE TO GO WHILE MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISSED ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GO
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY HER GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LETTER TALKING DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING US SKIRTING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN THAT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
