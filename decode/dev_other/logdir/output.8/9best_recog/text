7697-105815-0011 CHRISTEN GAVE FREE LEAVES FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLAYS AS THIS BLAST CROWDS BEST TWO
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT TOM THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VEIL WHERE HE SAW FREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTEN SIRS LET'S COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MANEST AND HIPPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN DE LAND THE FINE GLORY AND OUR ON OUR WAY TO MOUNTSIGN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 NOR YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR WOULD COME SET TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON BEST DOOR FOR LONG USE HAD MADE A LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAPPENED SILVER YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THERE NO DOUBT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ACT
7697-105815-0019 DO NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HEEL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING ALIVE HE DREAMED OF IT AND THEN WHEN TOOK FEW
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HUE AND THOSE WHO CAME BY NOT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMUROUS SAT THE ZION WAS FOR HERE THEY MEANT TO CLOUD BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORTISH SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THEY LAY TWO BEATS OF PREYN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SNAPPED HER LOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL IN US AND TEAR OUR WINGS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS CROW THAT HE MIGHT READ IT IN FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR ME BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FOUND DAWN ON HIS KNEES TO BREATHE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL BESIDES AND THEN WHEN BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 HO FOR THAT I AM SAID TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO THEY GAVE WAY TO THE FLASHES TO USE FOR YEAS THAT REST WHICH LORD OF FOR YOU HAD MADE BUT FORT HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LAW OF THE JEWS FOR THEY SEEN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF UGRATCY AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROT WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 SO FAR AND I HALF BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE BAY ONCE MORE WHERE A FORCE FELL HE SAID DYING WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SET LANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCREW WHICH HE CAUGHT IT WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BY HIS ROW
7697-105815-0033 HE LATE ENOUGH IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIE STOCK DID HE NOW CLEAN THE HUE
7697-105815-0035 HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEATS SPRANDING THE KNOT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MEN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THE CHRISTIAN MADE HELP AS IF HE WOULD DO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAT IS BY STRAND SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TOO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT EAR TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MEANS OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS THEY HEARD THEM ROAR IF THEY DID PAY NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT HOME WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LOT WHERE A WATCHFUL DOUBT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SOME WHAT HEALTH OF THIS MEN ARE RUSHED HERE TO NIGHT

7697-105815-0048 CHARITY NAY WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HALF MADE LEAVE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TO IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TO A BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SAT AT HIM
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASK WITH WHICH SENTENCED TO SUCH REFUSED AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DABBET SLEW GANIATH OF DEATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT HAS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS SEE MASTER'S LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HAVE BEING HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD OR AM NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JOT THOU JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STOOP LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THOSE YOU SAVE THIS MAN WHO HAST MADE SUCH A STORY NOW ATTOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE MUST HE'S LACK FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS BATH THE TREAD OF SAME WAY WAS CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GO HOPEFUL SECRETION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO WE SAT OFF THROUGH TO THE FIELD
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HATE CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HATH BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR HOUR GOODS
7697-105817-0008 PUSHING WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SET DRAWING DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAKING HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU'D LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE INFOLD
7697-105817-0011 AND BY BESACK WE KEEPED OUR SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BE MASTER OR OR MAN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INISCENCE MEN HAVE NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISBAD HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SUDDENLY DISAPPROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW WAS GOVERNOUS AND FEAR WERE THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 CERTAINLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A POVERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAID IN AS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE A OBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROMPT TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HER AND THIS COME HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THEIR REASON EXCEPT IT FROM THE MASTERSHIP OR GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS REGAINED ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED AT THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GAVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN COURT AS IN THE PRESENT DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS A BABING
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A MISHAPANISM MAY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE A BIT MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENT
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FITTING THE STATE OF HIM SINCE MAN HAD NOT BEEN IN OVERPENS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN ME REASON HAS THE POSITION OF MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUADITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSATIVE SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HATH BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STARRAL
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUT AT THE DISPERITY
7697-245712-0016 IN A QUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON A PARTS OF NATURE AS BOTH DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTIVE NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A MISTAKE OF MEDICINE MAN WOULD NOT HAPPY MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF ABSENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT A MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY COD OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CUT A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN A STATE OFNESS BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF CITIZENS THEY WOULD HAVE BE NO NECESSARY AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED AND FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE SYNIFNICENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGUN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAPPEN IN PERFECT IN EMBODIED SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF MEDICINES THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S COURSE AS IN GENERATION WOULD HAPPEN IN COMMONY WITH MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VANBAND IS IN PRESENT FORGET I SAID
8173-294714-0001 BUT I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HOPELESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME TO THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE PROPRIETY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE OFFENSIVE AND RAPT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN INSTRUCT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND UPON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE

8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN NEVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MIND GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO WAS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE TELLING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD CRY SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MI

8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD IN A SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILDHOOD
8173-294714-0019 BATTLE AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE ARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD IN THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHED IS CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY

8173-294714-0025 A YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORDS SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASE MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAVE HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INVATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INBATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVE ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVED TO BE FORGIVEN

8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VANPART
8173-294714-0036 DOES YOU SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY MEAN YOU HESITATE

8173-294714-0042 UNHEHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNEER THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE WARWARDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL ENCHANT AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE TEMPER A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THINKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THOUGH ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
