116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND UNTIL LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AT HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRACEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLIGHTLY INTO EAGER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY REGARD
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CANNOT THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AND IDEL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPED GODS THEY DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS AH PROTESTED MY HEART CLAM MADE MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO I SAID IN IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN EVIL THEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 HE MADE AFTHENS A SEA OF LIGHT HE CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT ANSWERED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS DANCE WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 GOODNESS HIM
116-288045-0015 I WISHED TO MYSELF WHAT BLESSED ME
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND HELD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNED DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT ALMOR
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM COMER THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLOLO IS NOT AN IDLE
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOOD AND THE SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN AND GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOW AND AND KNEELING BEFORE THEIR VARIOUS LIVES AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT A PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH HIS EXCEPTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AND IDLE
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WOULD SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWER INTO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WON TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 ILL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPTERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHAL THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FEEL WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTUR TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDLE AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES THEM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT THESES BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CAME A DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER FOR A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE AND FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILT UP IS IN OTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OF CAPRICE IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH AND A JAIL GAGING THE MOUTH OF A STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRIINNOW LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHO WAS HIS FORWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TILNEY WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH SHE TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 THE FIRSTNESS BE IMPERSONAL METHOD'S IRREVERENT BLASSUMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG IN A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM INBY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH A SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WENT IN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST AND MAY BUT THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BUT CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 I MAKE HIS ESSENTIAL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MINE CRAZ WERE KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD AS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN EMBORNING DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSEING ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS NICHOLLSE THE BROOMED HIM MAN WAS SATISFIED AND HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED HIS INADEQUASY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALISATION
116-288047-0004 THE MIDTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN IN INDIA HAS IN REPLACE BY ACTIVE INFORMATION CONCERN THE HINDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH HAS HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS USELESS
116-288047-0007 THERE IS A MEN OF FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS THAT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES OF BE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURB IN ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RUINLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FILLED A SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE ON AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE RECOVER AT THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH A FIRM GROUND UNDER WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SILENCE WAS NOT BORN TILL MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE CREEP SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES IN FACE OF MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL WAS THE BIRTH PLACE ASS SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILDHOOD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISGUST OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE AS GOD'S MOUTH PEACE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS REALLY REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACED OURSELVES ENTIRELY THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WOULD DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWN TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED WITH A CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF VARIOUS TIMES AS A BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSS WAS GIVEN NO DATE AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN FROM THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 MIGHTST DESCRIPTION SEE IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARIAN JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLAT TO EGYPT LOOPS HAS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COUNT THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH QUEER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHY IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUSIFIXION IS COMMMEORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VERY FREE OF A YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUAL NIGHTS AS THE FULL MOON LAUGHS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAG AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAK AND AUSTAIA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 THAT IN THE ACTIONS OF EVIDENCE ORGAN OFFERS A FOLLY METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS PYPICAL SENSEES ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY METHOD AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE I OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATELY COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEARED TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW THERE WAS LARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARRY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ACTUALLY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY NEVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW DOES IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MATH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS AH KEEP BY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF THESE TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD HE HAD BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOWLESS IS HIS UNANIMOUS SIDES TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE INNUMEROUS CANIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOSE
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE HE IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BUT A SWORD NOW AND BY WELL FAR HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JULIE'S MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOER MY LEAVERS TO QUARTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIMPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWER
116-288048-0027 HOW ME SELF TO LIVE PROPHETS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN MEMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH APPROACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YOU ASK NOTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MAKE JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A ROOMING AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES CYNISTOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERING US OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR IMMEDIATE OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRIIGHT AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BUSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FULL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE BOWL I HAVE ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMYER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FUNNY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG THEREAFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEM HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW VERY SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WAS SPEAKING ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 SIX THREE
1255-138279-0009 FORTY FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZENY YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMILE
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MOSSUL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY SMALL WELLPOLE
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOWS STRUCK A GAME IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THAT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE GLOOMY OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLOOD STOPPED IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I HOUSE WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 ONE I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 HOW MUST I IT IS WHERE SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE MONEY IT
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO HE WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO COST I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO TALK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NAME FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS AROUND THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE CONSCIOUS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED SINCE THE KNIGHT WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BASE
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEKED FOR SOME TODAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MANNER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE OF HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 POTATO RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAD HE LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS PLANT AND RESPECT TO HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FULL THE LEVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THAT POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE A MARRIED IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TROUBLE FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRIES IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BREATH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOR MASTER AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THAT MASTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO MUCH YOUR LEGISIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER FADE SO THAT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GUNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELBOWS AND SAID THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU READY WISH THAT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE BURIED IN UNLESS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK DOWN TO WALK ABOUT AN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I SOON AS YOU DONNED MY WORST IN STOCKING SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN PROVE HAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AN AH I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HAD NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG UP OUT OF SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGHT OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT YOU CRIED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD MAKE ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU MARRY ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK SOME
1255-90407-0006 HE HIS MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SAVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER IS AS A COMPARATIVE THE HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD TO MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HAD SOME
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL BE MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BEST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS COATING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WAS THAT THIS MORNING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE NEXT THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JUST AFFORDED STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MULTIBUS TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPITITES
1255-90407-0016 NOW I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUMPDOTH TIME IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THAT THERE WILL BE AT A HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WILL YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN EYEVENT STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FALSE OF THE ATAMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE SEATED HER BODILY BY INSERTLING HER WASTE WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHAT HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED US TO THE WITHDRAWER OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TOLD AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE GLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANTS TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SUNDAY TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT REVERNOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRAWING HIS PLAY THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPERY WRAPS AND SOME STIPLES FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MATE SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S DREAMMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPING MY GIRL SAID PEASANT
1255-90407-0028 HE A GAME BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHAIN WHICH TO BE INITIATE TO JOIN THE BOOK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WHERE OF THE SATIRE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE LOVE HIS CARRO
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFYS
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINNOVEN'S EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FAITHFUL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FIRM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT WHOLE
1255-90413-0004 BUT VOUS HE ABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GIVE FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPOSITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO COLLIMATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE DID NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTON SURE SQUARE AND HE WENT THERE THOUGH WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SAID HONESTLY LOST HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE BENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF CIRCUSING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUSTICE THEY TURNED MEDEERRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SAID THIS OLD EER HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTOR AND TWISTED ABOUT EM PUT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DIDY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH TO BE NEEDY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SAT IN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE WANINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME EARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DIDN'T YOU FEEL LIKE MEAN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNSAVIL THING TO SAY SHE MOMENT IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UN CIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT DEFTED HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM WITH LADY CHILD CLIFFS ALL THE NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSEPH AND PESTTON
1255-90413-0019 OR DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE ADAM WITH A STOP
1255-90413-0021 BUT JOSTIN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY ALLIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICKLE UPON AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FAST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS HE HAD A GUEST STRUCK IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FANTER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE OBJECT COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY AUGUSTINE'S LEFT WIFE OF A LAW TO JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTSIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMAL WORKMAN AND WAS CONCERNING HIS SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JUSTLY TO RECOMMEND HIS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOE RINGING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENS THE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THAT ENTERS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING OF HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE THAT IT IS FRESHLY COST A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS A CHIEF THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY A MATERIAL ARE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT DISMISSED THE APPARAGES A FORBID IS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR INATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWING THE INVENTION THE SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD KNIT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TROUBLE TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD OF HER FACTION IF CONCYVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLACE SALUTRY PART INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A HOE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ESCEPTIONS HAPPY LEFT FAST
1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGA OF THE ELECTRY ARTLIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENTS ARCHLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY VOCCAMIS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO THING UNDER FRENCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGLOSIDIC CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINENING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MONARD OF ELECTRILYING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST HIS SELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ATTICIN STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS DAY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY A MONSIEUR THAT ON TO THESE CONDITIONS THE MAUD LINING HUMP IS SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCONESCENT AND ARTLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SORES OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAPPY CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATTICON LINING COMPASS IN THE LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST DEAR FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GASMANAGEER DID NOT LIKE ARCHIED BUT IT INTERFERRED ONLY WITH HIS TREAT SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HAS LARGE A SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANIMALS
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALL WAS PARIS WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ANIMOUS
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOT UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT IS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HAUNTERS OF CITIES THEY LET TRICK AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSHING THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINENCE
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPIIGUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THE NEW YORK YOURSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WERE UPSPLENDY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE ISSUES NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE UDO
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GRAY MANY COUNTS WERE BEATEN AND RAT BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY EPITHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT AT IT AT A GREAT BARK AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DIM AND THE BALLAST AND WATERGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WOULD SELL THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY BY TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TWO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY OUT IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH COUNT A VERY GREAT SHAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT TO CLEW HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 AND THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DO THE WORD NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INSTANTLY IT MAY BE DONE IT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO MEDICINE THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HERISON AND EMPORING THE CHINESE TRADER WHEN TO HIM RANCH WANTED AS DINAMO TO BE RUN BY HEN POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOST ADDISONS APPEARED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROSE I WERE SON GO WHERE STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SECMUND BERDMAN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADAMSON UNTELLA FROM THE PARADISON FOONGRAPHS ANNE WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL IT IS THIS MORE WAY IN A LOFT YOUNG LUSTRE STREET NEW YORK WAS A SCIENCE HAS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES ATTERS FIFTY FUSES NUMEROUS OUT OF EAT HOUSE
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE ATASON ELECTURE LIGHT COMPANY LEAST A OD BEESCHALL MARTIAN AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW RIMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONDR SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS WESTONSHIRE AVENUE TO COME WORSE
1585-131718-0033 THEY EXPERIENCED WHAT A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS FARTHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DUG TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A RENT
1585-131718-0035 THE NEXT POOR OR FIVE YEAR SINCE IF I WAS A VERITABLE B HIGH DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY BEING ITS ARDANACQUATE OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING THE GENTLEMEN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOST THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER AN EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SECRES AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE UP WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THEIR RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE UTTER
1585-131718-0041 I I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TO BUSY HER OTHER THINGS TO DENNOTIC
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDIZAN SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GRAY VIOLINIST WAS RAMINEY
1585-131718-0044 WHO WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS FILINE
1585-131718-0045 WHY NOT HE CAME WITH HIS RAILING ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AS SIXTY FIVE LATE IN NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLENTS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HAT OF LONDON FIBRY GATE
1585-131718-0048 WHO WILL GO OUT AMONG THE HIGH LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLEST STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORY IS AT THE HAIR IS IN THEM FACTORY IN A YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING

1585-131718-0051 I HAVE NOTHING KNOWN TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COAT
1585-131718-0052 THEN THE GOB BLURRRY SEEMED HAD TO BE SHAPED TO FLORRY TO PROCURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF INTEREST AND DISSIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING MEDICINES EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE ASPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON IS GOUT AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MAN ARE LOADED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THAN BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE O STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRAYING ROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICO FASHION AND UTTER THE FALLING AATORICAL FLIGHT
1585-157660-0003 GLORA IS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SOUND A THING THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT THE VASTAGE OF THIS ONE OF HER MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WOLF BAT AND BEAT HIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE HURT AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S HEAVEN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS FLOORS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNINGED COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WELL AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIDE BOTTOMS LAYING IF IN FOAMING ARMS AND MORPHS UNTO THE POT OF KNOCK AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIDE OF THE SUN RISINGLAND TO GIVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXHITATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPLANATION FOUND AND MOST OFF THERE WERE MOST A PROMISES AND OFF A HEADS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS

1585-157660-0010 WELL INTO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DILLER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CINNIPOT WHICH WERE IMMEDIATELY KEPT BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOK AT ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE IT WORTH FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SENT MY LIFE UPON THE CAST I WILLWITHSTAND A HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BOO PERHAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPATIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JOPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RCIPRICCO
1585-157660-0015 THE PRIMY SHOP OF FOUL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL WAS TABLE AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES ROBYGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORMER WILLIAM AND BLURRY OUT IN HIS GLOVEMANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY REASON TRAVELERS IN THE BEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND IN EFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENED NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN PARTS IN THE HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OFTEN TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT THE MUTILATED MOST CHEERED OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMOTIONAL AND POLITICAL TREASUREMENT
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLEEVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS MORES TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BID ITS MORES ACROSS THE SOUND FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUST FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSE US AS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY QUIETLY A TRUE LAUGH OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT APIC OF THE CELL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHAPARDA GIVES US A UNTOFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 THEN THE AGE OF THE BUUDRE CAME HUMANITY WAS CHARRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS OUTEMMO'S DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HOUNDENED INTO AN AGE IF A NOTED CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED IT ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER MIGHT THE NEXT TROUBLE LAW OF EXPLOSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS IT MANY QUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURALLY AND A AND HARM ME WITH THY VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 MY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GREAT OFTEN IN ELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HELDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE ENOED THE LULLS OF LIFE AND GRANT
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A PALMON AND PACIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCES TO BEAR AN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MOSTRING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING US CHIEFS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY INAUDER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOPING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND A FIGHTING AND FREEDOM SCHOOLS
1630-102884-0016 EACH HAD PRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF THE NOTION WHICH HAS TO A PURITANS OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUE AND THEREFORE GIVES RICE TO SLAVERY THOUGH WITH TEN ITS BONE FREECE AND OUTSIDE

1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN IN HIS HEAD
1630-141772-0002 WORTH HIS FIRST THOUGHT
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOONED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A VAGUE SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 LIFT THE YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TATABLE BEING OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE TREASURE THE JOLTING RIGHT BEING MOVED AND THE CLOTHING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESS AND STATION
1630-141772-0006 YETING THIS TRANSFER HE FELL A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK
1630-141772-0007 HE PASSED ON SEEING THE PRISONERS

1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROKE FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SENSE SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHERE HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD EYECON PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOURITE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY KNOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE EYE CON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SATURDAY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT SHOULD BE TO KNOW THAT TO SEEK WHO HAVE IN THIS LIFE AND OUGHT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GRAY
