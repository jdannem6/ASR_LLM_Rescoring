116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND THE LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GRAY CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASSED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLIGHTLY INTO PETER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU WERE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GOD
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CAN LEFT THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AND I'DOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPED GUIDE THEY DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAM RAN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO NOT I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDOL MEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE AFTHENS A SEA OF LIGHT HE CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT IMPROVED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 ABUSE HIM
116-288045-0015 I WISHED ME TO MYSELF WHAT BLESSED FOR ME
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND HELD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNED DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HOMER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER BE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLE IS NOT AN IDLE
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF THE GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN AND GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOW AND AND KNEELING BEFORE THEIR VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND A MEAN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH HIS EXPRESSION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN IDEAL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WOULD A SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE SHE WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWER INTO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNING TOWARDS HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL HE KNOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOW SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHAEL THE EMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE PIECES AS MUCH OF AN IDLE AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS AS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH AN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE HOME TRUTH ABOUT DISEASES BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CAN A DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF FOOL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA WAS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILD UP IS IN OTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER CAPRICE IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH AND A JAIL JAGGING THE MOUTH OF A STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRIDAL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS FORWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 KEPT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELLING WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISHES TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 THE FIRSTLESS BE IMPERSONAL METHOD'S IRREVERENT BLASSUMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG IN A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM INDIAN
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH A SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WHEN IN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST AND MAY BUT A FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE WHAT CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 AMID HIS OFFENCEFUL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MINE CRAZ WERE KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD HAS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN IMPORTANT DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSING UP TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS NICHOLLS THE BROOMED HIM MAN WAS SATISFIED AND HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED HIS INANQUASY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALISATION
116-288047-0004 THE METHOD OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN IN INDIA HAS IN REPLACE BY ACTIVE INFORMATION CONCERN THE INDUES
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS THE PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JULIUS
116-288047-0007 THERE IS A MANNER OF FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS AND A GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES IT BE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURB IN ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RUINLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FEEL A SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FERRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE ON AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 BECOME AT THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET NOT REALLY BEGAN TO TOUCH A FIRM GROUND UNDER WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN TILL MAN I AM MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN TO PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FAITH AND MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL WAS THE FIRST PLACE AS SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCES OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTH PEACE AND NO ONE MAY DISREGARD WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS MANY REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY ON THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WOULD DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP WAS NOT ONLY COST IN THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED WITH A CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF VARIOUS TIMES AS A BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GUSS WAS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE IS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 MIGHT THIS DISCOVERY SEE IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARIAN JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED TO EGYPT LUCS IS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COUNT TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH BITTER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHILE IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUSIFIXION IS COMMEMERATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VERY FREE OF A YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUAL NIGHTS AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAG AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSTA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 THAT IN THE ACTIONS OF EVIDENCE ORGAN OFFERS A FOLLY METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS FYPTICAL SENSEES ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATELY COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW THAT WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER DUS AND MERRY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ACTUALLY NO EVIDENCE THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOWS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF AN MYTH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY WHEN WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUICE'LL KEEP BY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME YOU NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 ALICE IS HIS UNANIMOUS SIDES TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE INNUMEROUS CANADATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE HE IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BUT A SWORD NOW AND BY HALF FAR HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN VIEW'S MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOER MY LEADERS THE QUARTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JUSTICE COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS WERE ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF TO LIVE PRACTICE THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 I WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH APPROACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR A GOOD
116-288048-0030 WHEN HE SAID IF YOU ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEANS JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A REALLY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSABLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES CYNISTOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERING THINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO IT CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR IMMEDIATE OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRIIT AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BUSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FULL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL I HAVE ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LATER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE BUT IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY LONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THEY SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WAS SPOKEN ALIVE ONE
1255-138279-0008 TWO THIRTY THREE
1255-138279-0009 TWELVE FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HOW A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMARTER
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MOSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WELLPOLE
1255-138279-0014 THE WIDOW STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THAT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE AGONY OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLOOD SPOTT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I OFFER WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 WHERE I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 HO MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE MONKEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PERISHES DO ME WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO GIRLS I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGET TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD I FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS ARRANGE YOURSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTRIES NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE KNIGHT WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIET
1255-74899-0003 I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH EM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BOKED FOR SOME TO DAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THE REQUIRE TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 HE THEY WILL PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 POTATO RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAD HE LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS PLANT AND RESPECT TO HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LEVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THAT PULLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MARRIED IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TROUBLE FROM THE ONE PAUL VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRIES IN FAVOR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BATH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOR MASTER AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THOU MONSTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO MAKE YOUR LEGISERATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER FATE SO THAT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GODS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SAY THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE PAULES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU READY WISH YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN UNLESS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GUN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I SOON AS YOU DONNED MY WORSTED STOCKING SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO HUT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AN THOU'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT OF SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE REIGN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIDE OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT SHE CRIED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD NAME ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU NEAR ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK SO OF
1255-90407-0006 HE SAYS MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA COUNCIL ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER IS SAYS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIG UP ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HAD TO
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL US MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS COATED ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 HE WAS THAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE IN THE NETS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JUST AFFORDED STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTEWS TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPITENTS
1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUMPBOTH TIME IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THAT THAT WILL BE AT A HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHEN YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN EYEDENT STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FALSE OF THE EDIMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE SEATED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WASTE WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITYED HER AND WHY HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED IT TO THE WITHDRAWER OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GAS LIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW BUT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TOLD AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SUNDAY TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT REVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SAID ABOUT DRAWING HIS PLAY THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPERY WRAPS AND SOME STIPLES FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MATE SEVENT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ALMFUL OF WOMAN'S DREAMMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID JASON
1255-90407-0028 HE GAME BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHAIN WHICH TO BE INITIATED JOIN THE BOOK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WHERE OF THISATOR
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT IT LOVE HIS CORA
1255-90413-0000 SHE DROVES PLACE AND SATISFYES
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PIN DAVID'S EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER SPECIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FOAM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT ALWAYS
1255-90413-0004 BUT VOUSCABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GET FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPOSITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALLIMETATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE DID NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTON SHE SQUARE AND HE WENT THERE THOUGH WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIDY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY LOST HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE BENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUSTICE THEY TURN MEDEERA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SAID THIS OLD EER HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTOR AND TWISTED ABOUT EM PUT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DIDY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH WOULD BE NEARLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SAT IN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE WARNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY UN I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LATE MEAN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNSIVAL THING TO SAY SHE MOMENT IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNC CIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT DEFTED HIM TO FIND HIS WAY ART AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHILD CLIFFS ALL THE NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSEPH AND PHISTTON
1255-90413-0019 SO DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE KAVIN WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JUSTIM WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY ARIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAND LIGHT NICKLE UPON AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FRESH ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS HE HAVE THE GUESTS STRUCK IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FANTEL EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE DOMESTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY SUGGESTIONS LEFT WIFE OF A LAW TO JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTSIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMAN AND WAS CONSENTING HIS SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JUST IN TO RECOMMEND HIS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLAINNESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOE RINGING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENS THE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THINGS ENTERS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING ON HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE THAT IT IS TRUSTFUL COST A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS A CHIEF THE ADVENTURE MAKES ITS A PAIR ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY A MATERIAL ARE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN THE WEIGHTS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT DISMISS THE APPARATUS A FORBID IS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR INATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWING THE INVENTION THE SEEKING THE HIGH A GOOD KNIT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD OF HER FACTION IF CONCYVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLACE SALUTRY PART INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A HOE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ECEPTIONS HAPPEN THUS FAST
1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGO OF THE LAPRY ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENTS ARCHLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY VOCCAMIS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRENCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGLOSIDIC CONTRACTS FROM STREET LINENING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CURIOUS MANNER THE MONARD OF ELECTRILYING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST HIS SELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS ADAPTABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ATTICOM STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY A MONSIEUR THAT ON TO THESE CONDITIONS THE MAUD LINING HUMP IS SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCONESCENT AND ARTLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SHORES OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OWN FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAPPEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATTIC AND MINING COMPASS IN THE LEADING CITIZEN
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS ENGLISH GREW
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST GREATER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GASMANAGEER DID NOT LIKE ARCHIED BUT IT INTERFERRED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGE A SOURCE OF INCOME BY ENEMIES
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVENZING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALL WAS CURIOUS WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ANOMOUS
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOT UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT IS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF CITIES THEY LET TRICK AND GAS PROMISE ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSHING THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINENCE
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPIIGUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THE NEW YORK HIMSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WERE EXPLENDY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER AN URGERS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE UDO
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GRAY MANY COUNTS WERE READEN AND RAT BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY EPITHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT AT IT AT A GREAT BARK AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DIM AND THE BALLAST OF WATERGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WOULD SELL THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY BY TWENTY WITH THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY OUT IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LAST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CALLED A VERY GREAT SHAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELINGS AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 AND THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORD NOSLY
1585-131718-0028 EVIDENTLY IT MAY BE DONE IT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO MEDICINE THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HERISON AND EMPORING THE CHINESE TRADER WHEN TO HIM INCH WANTED A DINAMO TO BE RUN BY HEN POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMMOS ADDISONS APPEARED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROSE I WERE SON GO WHERE STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SECMUND BERDMAN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADAMSON UNTELLA FROM THE PARADISON FOONGRAPHS ANNE WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL IT IS THIS MORE WAY IN A LOFT YOUNG LUSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS A SCIENCE HAS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES ATTERS FIFTY FUSS NUMEROUS OUT OF THE EAT HOUSE
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE ATASON ELECTURE LIGHT COMPANY LEAST A OD BEESCHA A MARTIAN AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEAD QUARTERS AND SHOW RIMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND HIS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONDR SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESTINSHIRE AVENUE TO COME WORSE
1585-131718-0033 THEY EXPERIENCED WITH A LITTLE GASE ENGINE WAS FARTHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT ONE DUG TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOOD EXPLORING A RENT
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT PEARL OR FIVE YEAR SIX IF I WAS A VERITABLE B HIGH DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY BEING ITS ARONACQUATE OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING THE GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOST THEM ALL IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER AN EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGERS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE UP WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THAT RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I FOUND NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBERED ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TO BUSY HER OTHER THINGS TO DENOCE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISAN SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GRAY VIOLINIST WAS RAMONY
1585-131718-0044 WHO WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS FILING
1585-131718-0045 WHY NOT HE CAME WITH HIS BORROWING ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL HIS SIXTY FIVE LATE IN NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINGS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HAT OF LONDON FIREBURY GATE
1585-131718-0048 WHO GO OUT AMONG THE FINE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELL US STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORY IS AT THE HAIRS IN THEM FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING

1585-131718-0052 THEN THE GOB BLURRY SEEMED HAD TO BE SHAPED TO FLORA TO PROCURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF INTEREST AND DISSIPATION AND THE PARENTOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING ABSENCE'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON IS GOAD AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MAN ARE MOTORED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THAN BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE O STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRAYING ROSE HILL WILLIAM STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICO FASHION AND UTTER THE FALLING ARTORICAL FLOOD
1585-157660-0003 GLOR IS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SOUND A THING THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT THE VASTAGE OF THIS ONE OF HER MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WAFT THAT AND BEAT HIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE HURT AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLEND AND DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVILS HEAVEN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIAN'S FLOORS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNYED COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WELL AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIDE BOTTOMS LAYING IF IN FOAMING ARMS AND MORPHUS UNTO THE POT OF KNOCK AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIDE OF THE SUN RISINGLAND AND GIVES GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXHITATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPLANATION FAST AND MOST OFF THERE WERE MOST A PROMISES AND OFF A HEADS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS

1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SENT MY LIFE UPON THE CAST I WILL STAND THE HAZARD OF THE DAY
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FAMILY JOKING WITH A LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BOO PERHAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JOPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RCIPPERCO
1585-157660-0015 THE PRINTING SHOP OF FOUL WAS OWNING A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL WAS TABLE AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES ROBYGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORMER WILLIAM AND BLURRY OUT IN HIS GLOVEMANER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY REASON TRAVELLES IN THE BEST I FELT THAT OUT THEIR FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND IN EFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENED NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE REST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN PART IN THEIR HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE REST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT THE MUTILATED MOST CHEERED OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMOTIONAL AND POLITICAL TREADMA
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLEEVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS MORES TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BID ITS MORES ACROSS THE SUN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUST FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSE US AS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY QUIET A TRUE LAP OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT APIC OF THE CELL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHAPARDA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUUDRE CAME HUMANITY WAS CHARGED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS OUTEMMO'S DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HOUNDENED INTO AN AGE IF I NOTED CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED AT ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER MIGHT BE NEXT DOUBLE LAW OF EXPLOSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS IT BEEN QUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURALLY AND AH AND HARM ME WITH THOSE VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 MY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GREAT OFTEN IN ELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HELDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LULLS OF LIFE AND GRANT
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A PALMON AND PACIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO BEAR AN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MOSTRING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING US CHIEFS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY INAU NO ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND A FIGHTING AND FREEDOM SCHOOLS
1630-102884-0016 EACH HAD PRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF THE NOTION WHICH HAS TO A PUREANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RICE TO SLAVERY THOUGH WITH TEN ITS BOUND FREECE AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE PLATS AND HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAG STAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLGONSKY BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND JY LIKE MOON
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BONING LACERATING PAIN IN HIS HEAD
1630-141772-0002 WITH HIS FIRST THOUGHT
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A VAGUE SICKLY GLOW WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 LEAVING THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TATIBLE BEING OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE TREASURE THE JOLTING RIGHT BEING MOVED AND THE CLOTHING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 YARDING THIS TRANSFER HE FELL A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK

1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED WHEN THE LITTLE EYECON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT SHOULD BE TO KNOW THAT TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND OUGHT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GLEAM
