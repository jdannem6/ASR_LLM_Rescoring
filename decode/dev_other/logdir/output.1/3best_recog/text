116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE AND FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMEN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALLY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLIGHTLY TO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GUARD
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CAN LOVE THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AND IDOL I WHISPERED TAKE HIM BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIP GOD THEY DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAM LAY IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO I SAY IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDLE MAN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE AFENS A SEA OF LIGHT HE CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANTS WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 PRODUCED HIM
116-288045-0015 I WISHED TO MYSELF WHAT BLESSS FOR ME
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNED DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HOMEER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HUMR THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLOW IS NOT AN IDLE
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND IS SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN AND GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOW AND AND KNEELING BEFORE THEIR VARIOUS LINES AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND A MEAN OF ALL THIS MY GOD TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT A PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH HIS GESTURE OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN IDLE
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WOULD A SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WON'T TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 WELL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEN TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE EMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FEEL WITH WONDER IN MY VOICE QUIVING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE DISEASE AS MUCH OF AN IDLE AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH AND APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT DISEASE BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPENING AND CAN A DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER LIVE FOR A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA HE IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILD UP IS IN OTHER CHRISTIAN ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER A PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH AND A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRIINNOW LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 THE FIRSTLESS BE IMPERSONAL METHOD'S IRREVERENT BLASSUMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG IN A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM INBY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOUR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH A SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WHEN IN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST AND MAY BUT THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE WHAT CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 AMID HIS OFFICIAL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAZ WERE KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASK QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN EMBORNING DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSING ENOUGH TO STOP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS NICHOLAS THE BROOMED HIM MAN WAS SATISFIED AND WHOSE DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED HIS INANQUASY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALISATION
116-288047-0004 THE MITH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN IN INDIA HAS IN REPLACE BY ACTIVE INFORMATION CONCERN THE HINDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISE THE USE TO WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS SMITH
116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN MAN OF FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS AND IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CARB IN ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RUINLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FILLED A SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE IN AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 RECOVER AT THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET NOT REALLY BEGINNING TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNDER WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN UNTIL MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATED SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WHOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FACE AND MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL WAS THE BIRTH FACE AS SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENTIST OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO A MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE HAS GOD'S MOUTH PEACE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS DAY REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE YOURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WOULD DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED WITH A CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF VARIOUS TIMES AS A BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GUS WAS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENT THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 MIGHT AS DESCRIPTION SEE IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARIAN JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLAT TO EGYPT LUC SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COUNT TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHY IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUSIFIXION IS COMMEMERATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VERY FEW YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUAL MONTHS AS THE FULL MOON LAUGHS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAG AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAKIN AUSTAIA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 THAT IN THE ACTIONS OF EVIDENCE ORIGIN OFFERS A FOLLY METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS TYPICAL SENSEES ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY METHOD YET ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE WAS ACTUALLY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A METH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE I SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPIED BY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF THIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD I HAD BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOWLESS IS HIS UNANIMOUS SIGNS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE INNUMEROUS CANIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BUT A SWORD NOW AND BY HOW FAR HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN VIEWS MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT LEADERS TO QUARTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLEDS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERSMEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF TO LIVE PROPHETS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE GREATER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH APPROACHERS OF THE DAY GIVE HE PARED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS RE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR A GOOD
116-288048-0030 FOR HE SAID IF YOU ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEET JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A ROOM AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES CYNICLESSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR IMMEDIATE OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS RIGHT AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BUSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FULL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL I HAVE ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMYER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLUES PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 BUT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMEDHUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH A SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WAS BROKEN ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 FOUR THREE
1255-138279-0009 FOOL FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHIP ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLA
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MOSTLE OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WELL PULL
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW IS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THAT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPEN OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLOOD SPOTTING THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 WHAT I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 WHO MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE MONEY AND
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DU ME WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO COARSE I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACTES I FORGOT TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT FRANCS GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS ARRANGED THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE CONTRAST NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED SINCE THE NIGHT WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WILL MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BAKED FOR SOME TODAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A METHOD THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IT HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WILL PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT UP HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 POTATO RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAD HE LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS PLANT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LEVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THAT PULLS ASUNDER FOR ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MARRIED IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TROUBLE FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOR MISTER AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THAT MONSTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO MAKE YOUR LEGISATIVE THAN ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER AFRAID SOME THAT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GUNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SAY THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE PULLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE BURIED IN ALAS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK DOWN TO WORK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 AS SOON AS YOU DAWNED MY WORST IN STOCKING SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO THOUGHT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AND I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HAD NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT OF SUCH AN UNTOWORD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE SAID
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD NAY ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU MAY ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK OF
1255-90407-0006 HES MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHERS IS AS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGR ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HAD SIR
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS COPY ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 IS THAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE NECKS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JUST AFFORDED STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MULTITUDE TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPITALS
1255-90407-0016 NOW I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUMPTH TIME IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THEY WILL BE AT A HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WILL YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN IRON STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FALSE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE SEATED HER BODILY BY INCIRCLING HER WASTE WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHY HE WANDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED IT TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW FOR THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TOLD AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANTS TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SUDDENLY TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRAWING HIS PLAY THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME STIPLES FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MATE SEVENT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ALMFUL OF WOMAN'S DREAMMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE ASLEEP MY GIRL SAID PEASON
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH TO BE INITIATED JOIN THE BOOK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WHERE OF THISATA
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT IT LEFT HIS CARRO
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS PLACE AND SATISFYIES
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE DAVID'S EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER SPECIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 FOR THIS WAS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT VOUS HELL
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GIVE FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALLIMITATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE DID NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTON SHOW SQUARE AND HE WENT THERE THOUGH WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIDY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE BENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUSTICE THEY TURNED MEDEERRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SAID THIS OLD EER HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTOR AND TWISTED ABOUT EM PUT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DEBTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH TO BE NEARLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SAT IN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY BUT I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL THAT I MEAN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVAL THING TO SAY SHE MOMENT IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNSIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY ART AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM WITH LADY JOHN CLIFFS ALL THE NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSEPH AND PESTON
1255-90413-0019 HER DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE HAVING WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JUSTIN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WEDDING'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY AREIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICKLE UPON AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE BEST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS HE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT OF THE TABLE FANTA EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THEISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY INJUSTICE LEFT WIFE OF A LAW TO JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTSIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMAN AND WAS CONCERNING HIS SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JUSTLIN TO RECOMMEND HIS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOE RUNNING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENS THE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THESE ENTERS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING ON HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE THAT IT IS FRESH FOR COST A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS A CHIEF THE ADVENTURE MAKES ITS A PAIR ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY A MATERIAL ARE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN THE WEIGHTS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT DISMISS THE APPARAGES A FORBID IS VERY USED
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY ARE INATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALING THE INVENTION THE SEEKING THE HIGH A GOOD KNIT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD OF HER FACTION IF CONCYVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAYED SALUTRY PART AND INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A HOE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ESCEPTIONS HAPPEN LEFT FAST
1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGO OF THE ELECTRY ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCONDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF APPARENT ARCLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMNESS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRENCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGLOSIDIC CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINENING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CURIOUS MANNER THE MONARD OF ELECTRILYING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST HIS SELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDINGLY FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ATTICING STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS DAY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY AND MONSIEUR THAT ON TO THESE CONDITIONS THE MAUD LINING HUMP IS SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCONESCENT AND ARTLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SORES OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAPPEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATTICON LINING COMPASS IN THE LEADING CITIZEN
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INGENIOUS GROUP
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GASMANAGEER DID NOT LIKE ARCHIED BUT IT INTERFERRED ONLY WITH HIS TREAT SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGE A SOURCE OF INCOME BY ENEMIES
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVENZING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALL WAS CURIOUS WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ENEMIES
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NO UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT IS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HAUNTERS OF CITIZEN THEY LEFT WEAK AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSHING THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINENCE
1585-131718-0018 A MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THE NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WERE SPLENDY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER AN ISSUES NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACT OF UDO
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GRAY MANY COUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND RAT BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT AT AT A GREAT BARK AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DIM AND THE BALLAST OF WATERGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WOULD SEW THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY WITH THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TWO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY ACT IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LAST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH COUNT A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CW HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 A THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORD NICELY
1585-131718-0028 EVIDENTLY IT MAY BE DONE IT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO MEDICINE THAT WHILE HE HAD A FACTORY AT HERISON AND EMPORING THE CHINESE TRADER WHEN TO HIM INCH WANTED AS DINAMO TO BE RUN BY HEN POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DINAMOS ADDISONS APPEARED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROSE I WERE SON GO WHERE STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SECMUND BERDMAN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADAMSON UNTELLA FROM THE PARADISON FOONGRAPHS ANNE WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL IT IS THIS MORE WAY IN A LOFT YOUNG LUSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS A SCIENCE HAS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES HETERS FIFTY FUSS NUMEROUS OUT OF EACH HOUSE
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE ATASON ELECTURE LIGHT COMPANY LEAST A OD BEESIA NATION ACT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW RIMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND HIS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONDR SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS WESTONSHIRE AVENUE TO COMERS
1585-131718-0033 THEY EXPERIENCED WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT ONE DONE TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOOD EXPLORING A RENT
1585-131718-0035 THE NEXT PEARL FIVE YEAR SINCE IF I WAS A VERITABLE BIVE DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY BEING ITS ARONACLET OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING THE GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOST THEM OUT IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER AN EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRAS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THAT RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MURDER
1585-131718-0041 I HAD DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TO BUSY HER OTHER THINGS TO DENO NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISAN SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GRAVE VIOLINIST WAS RAMINEY
1585-131718-0044 WHO WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VILEINE
1585-131718-0045 WHY NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS BOILING ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AS SIXTY FIVE LATE A NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HAT OF LONDON FIBURY GATE
1585-131718-0048 WHO WILL GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLEST STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORY'S AT THE HAIR IS IN THEM FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING

1585-131718-0052 THEN THE GOB BLURRRY SEEMED HAD TO BE SHAPED TO FLORA TO PROCURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF INTEREST AND DISSIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING MEDICINE'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATIONS WAS REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON IS GHOST AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MAN ARE LOADED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD

1585-157660-0003 GLAMOUR IS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SOUND A THING THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT THE VASTAGE OF THIS ONE OF HER MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WOLF BAT AND BEAT HIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE HURT AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLEND AND DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S HEAVEN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIAN'S FLOORS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNYED COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WELL AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIDE BOTTOMS LAYING IF IN FOING ARMS AND MORPHORUS UNTO THE POT OF KNOCK AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIDE OF THE SUN RISINGLAND IT GIVES GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXHITATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPECTATION FAST AND MOST OFF THERE WERE MOST A PROMISES AND OFF A HEADS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND SPARE MOST FITS

1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND A JOKING WITH A LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BOO PERHAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JOPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RCIPRACO
1585-157660-0015 THE PRIMING SHOP OF FOUL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL WAS TABLE AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES ROBERT GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORMER WILLIAM AND BLURRY OUT IN HIS GLOVE MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY REASON TRAVELLERS IN THE BEST I FELT THAT OUT THEIR FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND IN EFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THE HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVEN TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT THE MUTILATED MUCH CHEERED OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMOTIONAL AND POLITICAL TREASUREMENT
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLEEVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS MORES TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BID ITS MORES ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRESS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSE US AS MARVEL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY INQUIRED A TRUE LAUGH OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT APIC OF THE CELL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHAP POWDER GIVES US A UNTOFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDRE CAME HUMANITY WAS CHARGED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS ARTEMO'S DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HOUNDED INTO AN AGE IF INNOTE CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER MIGHT BE NEXT TROUBLE LAW OF EXPLOSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS IT MANY QUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURALLY AND AH AND HUM ME WITH THOSE VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 MY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GREAT OFTEN IN ELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HELDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LULLS OF LIFE AND GUILT
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A HOMEMAN AND PACIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOMENTING CIRCUMSTANCES TO BEAR AN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MOSTRING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING US CHAPTERS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY IN ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HURRIEDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND A FIGHTING AND FREEDOM SCHOOLS
1630-102884-0016 EACH YET PRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF THE NOTION WHICH HAS TO A PUREANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUE AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY THOUGH WITH TEN ITS BONE FREECE AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE PLANTS IN HEIGHTS THERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAG STAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLGONSKY BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND JY LIKE MOON
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FAILED THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BONY LACERATING PAIN IN HIS HEAD

1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A VAGUE SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 LEFT THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TATABLE BEING OFF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE TREASURE THE JOLTING RIGHT BEING MOVED AND THE CLOTHING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELL A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK
1630-141772-0007 HE ASKED ON SEEING THE CHRISTMAS

1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIN TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SAD SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHERE HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD EYECON PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOUR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY KNOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED WHERE THE LITTLE EYE CON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE TO KNOW THAT TO SEEK WHO HAVE IN THIS LIFE AND OUGHT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GRAY
