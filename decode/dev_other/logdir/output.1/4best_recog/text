116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE AND FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW GENTLEMEN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GREATLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENTS SLIGHTLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GOOD
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CAN UP THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKE HIM BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIP OF GOD THEY DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAM LAY MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NOW I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IOL THEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A SEA OF LIGHT HE CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT ENTROUBED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS HANDS WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 PRUDENCE HIM
116-288045-0015 I WISHED IT TO MYSELF WHAT BLESSED FOR ME
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNED DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HARMR
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HAMR THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NOW NO APOLLO IS NOT AN IDLE
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND THIS SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN AND GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOW AND KNEELING BEFORE THEIR VARIOUS LIVES AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEAN OF ALL THIS MY GOD TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT A PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH HIS AGITATION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY A IDLE
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WOULD A SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWER INTO HIS NAME WITH DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANTED TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL HE NOT BE HEAR THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASK AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE EMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FEEL WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDLE AS APOLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD I WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE HOME TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CAN A DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLETITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH AND EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOG MA IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILT UP IS IN OTHER CHRISTIAN ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OF PREACH IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH AND A JAIL YAGGING THE MOUTH OF A STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRIINAL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS FORWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELLING WHAT OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 THE FIRSTLESS BE IMPERSONAL METHOD'S IRREVERENT BLASSUMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG IN A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM IN B
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOUR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH A SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WENT IN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST AND MAY BUT THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE WHAT CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 AMID HIS OFFICIAL EXCLAMATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAZ WERE KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD HAS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN EMBORNING DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSING ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS NICHOLLSE THE BROOMED HIM MAN WAS SATISFIED AND HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED HIS INANQUASY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALISATION
116-288047-0004 THE METHOD OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN IN INDIA HAS IN REPLACE BY ACTIVE INFORMATION CONCERN THE INDIES
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY A USE TO WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS MATH
116-288047-0007 THERE IS A MAN OF FACULTY FOR FIICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS AND GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CARB IN ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RHYTHMLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FEEL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE ON AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE COME AT THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET NOT REALLY BEGUN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNDER WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN TILL MAN AM MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN AT PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FACE IN MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL WAS THE BIRTH PLACED AS SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SIGNS OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THESE SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTH PIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TOO REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACED OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WOULD DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COST IN THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWN TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED WITH A CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF VARIOUS TIMES AS A BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GUSTS WAS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 MIGHTEST DESCRIPTION SEE IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARIAN JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED TO EGYPT LOOPS IS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH BITTER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHY IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUSIFIXION IS COMMEMERATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VERY FEW YEARS A YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUIONCE AS THE FULL MOON LAUGHS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAG AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAKAN AUSTAIA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 THAT IN THE ACTIONS OF EVIDENCE ORGAN OFFERS A FOLLY METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS FYPICAL SENSEES ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY WITHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEARED TO BE ON OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW HE WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDUS AND MERRY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ACTUALLY KNOW EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW WAS THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYDTH
116-288048-0016 IT WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUICE OCCUPIED BY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHILE THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF THIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAD BEEN IN THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 ALICE IS HIS UNANIMOUS SCIENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE ANNUMEROUS CANIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOSE
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BUT A SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FAR HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JU'S MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GARMENT LEADERS TO QUARTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLE CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS BUT ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW ME SELF TO LIVE OFFICE THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BETTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH APPROACHERS OF THE DAY GIVE HE PARED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS RE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF HE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHEN HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORE DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES CYNISTOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FROM AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR IMMEDIATE OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRAIT AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BUSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FULL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR IRREGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LAUGHTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVEREDABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THEIR SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WAS SPOKEN LOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 THREE
1255-138279-0009 FALL FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT FIVE A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED S MOREA
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MOSLE OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLING SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY SMALL WELL POLE
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THAT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF A WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLADE SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I US WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 WHILE I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 OH MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE TWENTY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DUE ME WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO PULSE I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOTTEN TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD KNIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS ARRANGE OURSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE AWAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED SO THE KNIGHT WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WILL MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEAKED FOR SOME TO DAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRE TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PROVIDED HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 EVEN THEY WILL PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 POTATO RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAD HE LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS PLANT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FULL THE LEVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THOU PULLS ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE A MARRIED IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TROUBLE FROM ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOR MISTER AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MONSTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO MAKE YOUR LEGISITIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER TRADE SOME THAT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GODS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SAID THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE PALES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU READY WITH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN THAT LAST ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK DOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 AS SOON AS YOU DAWNED MY WORSTED STOCKING SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO THE HAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HAD NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG US OUT OF SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIDE OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE INQUIRED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD MARRY ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU NEED ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK SUCH
1255-90407-0006 HE' IS MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER IS AS A COMPARATIVE OF THE HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIG OF ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HAD SAY
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL HE MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS COATY ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WAS THAT THAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE NIGHTS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JUST AFFORDED STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTEBUS TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPITENTS
1255-90407-0016 NOW I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUMPOTH TIME IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE IN A HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WILL YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN IDENT STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE EDIMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE SEATED HER BODILY BY INSULTING HER WASTE WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WANDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED IT TO THE WITHDRAWL OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SUDDENLY TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT REVENSELY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRAWING HIS PLAY THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPERY WRAPS AND SOME STIPLES FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MATE SEVENT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S DREAMMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPING MY GIRL SAID PEASON
1255-90407-0028 HE GAME BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH TO BE INITIATED JOIN THE BOOK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WHERE OF THISATAR
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT IT LOVE HIS CARRO
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS PLACE AND SATISFIED
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE DAVID'S EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER OFFICIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT UPON A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT OLD
1255-90413-0004 BUT VOUSSEABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FARTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO COLIMATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE DID NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTON SHALL SQUARE AND HE WENT THERE THOUGH WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIDY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO HONESTLY LOST HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE BENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SUITING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUSTICE THEY TURN MEDEERRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SAID THIS OLD EER HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTOR AND TWISTED ABOUT EM BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DEBTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH TO BE NEARLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SAT IN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE WARNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY THAT I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL I MEAN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNSIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MOMENT IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNCIVAL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM WITH LADY TEMPLE CLIFFS ALL THE NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSEPH IN PYSTON
1255-90413-0019 HOW DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE DAVID WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JUSTIN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WHITHER'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY AREIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LANDLIGHT NICKLE UPON AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVED
1255-90413-0024 AS HE HAVE A GUEST STRUCK IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FAANTA EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THEUTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ENGAGEMENTS LEFT WIFE OF A LAW TO JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTSIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMAN AND WAS CONCERNING HIS SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JUST THEN TO RECOMMEND HIS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVENING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENS THE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THING ENTERS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING OF HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE THAT IT IS FRESH COST A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS A CHIEF THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY A MATERIAL ARE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN THE WEIGHTS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT DISMISS THE APPARAGES A FORBID IS VERY USED
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY ARE INATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALING THE INVENTION THE SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD KNIT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TROUBLE TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD OF HER FACTION IF CONCYVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAYED SALUTRY PART AND INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A HOE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS EXCEPTIONS HAPPEN LEFT FAST
1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGO OF THE ELECTRY ARTLIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCONDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF APPARENT ACLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY VOCAL COMNESS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRENCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGLOSIDIC CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINENING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CURIOUS MANNER THE MONARD OF ELECTRILINEING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST HIS SELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ATTICOM STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS DAY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY AND MONSIEUR THAT ON TO THESE CONDITIONS THE MAUD LINING HUMP IS SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCONESCENT AND ARTLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SORES OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OWN FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAPPY CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATTICON MINING COMPASS IN THE LEADING CITIZEN
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS ENGLISH GROUP
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BETTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GASMANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCHIED BUT IT INTERFERRED ONLY WITH HIS TREAT SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HAS LARGE A SOURCE OF INCOME BY ENEMIES
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVENZING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALL WAS PARIS WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ANIMOUS
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NO UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT IS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HAUNTERS OF CITIES THEY LET TRICK AND GAS PROMISE ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSHING THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINENCE
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THE NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THEY ARE WORKS PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER AN ISSUES NOT EQUAL TO BE DREADED WITH ACT OF UDO
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GRAY MANY COUNTS WERE EATEN AND RAT BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY EPITHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT AT AT A GREAT BARK AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DIM AND THE BALLAST AND WATERGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WOULD SHOW THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY WITH THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY AT IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LAST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CALLED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED WHEN OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOD A CLEW HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 AND THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH THROUGH THE WORD NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INSTANTLY IT MAY BE DONE IT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO MEDICINE THAT WHILE HE HAD A FACTORY AT HERISON AND EMPORING THE CHINESE TRADER WHEN TO HIM INCH WANTED AS DINAMO TO BE RUN BY HEN POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DINAMMOST ADDISONS APPEARED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROSE I WERE SON GO WHERE STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SECMUND BERDMAN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADAMSON UNTELLA FROM THE PARADISON FOONGRAPHS ANNE WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL IT IS THIS MORE WAY IN A LOFT YOUNG LUSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS A SCIENCE HAS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES HETERS FIFTY FUSES NUMEROUS OUT OF THE EAT HOUSE
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE ATASON ELECTURE LIGHT COMPANY LEAST A OD BEESIA NATION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND HIS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMINENTER SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS WESTONSHIRE AVENUE TO COMERS
1585-131718-0033 THEY EXPERIENCED WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINEER WAS FARTHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DUG TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOOD EXPLORING A RENT
1585-131718-0035 THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEAR SINCE IF I WAS A VERITABLE B HIGH DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY BEING ITS ARONACWOOD OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOST THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER AN EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGARS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THEIR RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MUTTERED
1585-131718-0041 I COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TO BUSY HER OTHER THINGS TO DET NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISAN SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREY VIOLINIST WAS RAMINE
1585-131718-0044 WHO WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLING
1585-131718-0045 WHY NOT HE CAME WITH HIS SMILING ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AS SIXTY FIVE LATE A NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINGS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HAT OF LONDON IN FIBURY GATE
1585-131718-0048 WHO WILL GO OUT AMONG THE FINE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLEST STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HAIR IS IN THEM FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINDER AND HE WAS ALLING FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING WRONG TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COAT
1585-131718-0052 THEN THE GOD BLURRRY SEEMED HOW TO BE SHAPED TO FLORA TO PROCURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF INTEREST AND DISSIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING LEVISON'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACT OF EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON ISGOAT AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MAN ARE NOTED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE O STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRAYING ROSE HILL WELL STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICO FASHION AND UTTER THE FALLING ARTORICAL FLIGHT
1585-157660-0003 GLAOR IS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SOUND A THING THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT THE VASTAGE OF THIS ONE OF HER MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WOLF THAT AND BEAT HIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE HURT AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVILS HEAVEN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS FLOORS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNINGED COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WELL AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIDE BOTTOMS LAYING IF IN FOAMING ARMS AND MORPHORUS UNTO THE POT OF KNOCK AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIDE OF THE SUN RISINGLAND AND IF ITS GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXHITATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPECTATIONS AND MOST OFF THERE WERE MOST A PROMISES AND OFF A HEADS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS
1585-157660-0009 DEUCEAS ONE DOUBLE WHEN SIX IS TROBICALLY
1585-157660-0010 WELL INTO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DELLER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CINNIPOT WHICH WERE IMMEDIATELY KEPT BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS TO LOOK AT ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION

1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SENT MY LIFE UPON THE CAST I WILL STAND THE HAZARD OF THE EYE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND A JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BOO PERHAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JOPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RCIPROCCO
1585-157660-0015 THE PRIMY SHOP OF FOUL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL WAS TABLE AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES ROBBAGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORMER WILLIAM AND BLURRY OUT IN HIS GLOVE MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY REASON TRAVELLERS IN THE REST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND IN EFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE REST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN PAR IN THE HANDS
1630-102884-0003 AS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVEN TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT THE MUTILATED MUCH CHEERED OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMOTIONAL AND POLITICAL TREADMEN
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLEEVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS MORES TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BID ITS MORES ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUST FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSE US AS MARVEL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY QUIET A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT APIC OF THE CELL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHAPARDA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FOR OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 THEN THE AGE OF THE BUUDRE CAME HUMANITY WAS CHARRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS OUTTIMO'S DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HOUNDENED INTO AN AGE IF IN NOTE CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED AN ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER MIGHT BE NEXT TROUBLE LAW OF EXPLOSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS IT MANY QUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND AH AND HARM ME WITH THOSE VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 MY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GREAT OFTEN IN ELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HELDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE ENOED THE LULLS OF LIFE AND GUILT
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A HOMEMAN AND PACIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOMENTING CIRCUMSTANCE TO BEAR AN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MOSTRING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING US TIPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY IN ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE

1630-141772-0004 LIFTED THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TATABLE BEING OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE TREASURE THE JOLTING RIGHT BEING MOVED AND THE GLOBEING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION

1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED WHERE THE LITTLE EYE CON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SATURDAY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE TO KNOW THAT TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND OUGHT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GLEAM
