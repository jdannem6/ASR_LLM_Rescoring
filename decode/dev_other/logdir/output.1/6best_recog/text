116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY THITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A DEEP BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MIND
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLIDING INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TWO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GOD
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CAN HELP THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AND IDOL I WHISPERED TAKING BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPBED GOD THEY DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS UP PROTESTED MY HEART CLAM LAY MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 KNOW I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDOL MAN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 HE MADE AFFENS A SEA OF LIGHT HE CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT ENTROGGED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ELSE WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 INDUCE HIM
116-288045-0015 I WISHED TO MYSELF WHAT BLESSED TO ME
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND HELD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNED THE DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HOME HER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER THE INSPIRED BARED
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO IS NOT AN TITLE
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND A SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN AND GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THEIR VARIOUS LINES AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 ABSORBING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND A MEAN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT A PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET A FOLLOW HE SAID WITH HIS SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN TITLE
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WOULD A SEARCH FOR APOLLO AND ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWER INTO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WENT TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 SHALL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPRS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEN TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHAL THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILL WITH WONDER IN MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE MUSIC AS MUCH OF AN IDLE AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD I WILL NOT FAITH AN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT PROOF TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CAN A DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE AT HAND THAN IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER LIVE FOR A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERY THING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DID NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILT UP IS ANOTHER CHRISTIAN ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OF PRAISE IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASSING TRUTH AND A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF A STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRINAL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR WRITES POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 THE FIRSTLESS BE IMPERSONAL METHOD'S IRREVERENT BLASSUMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG IN A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM INPI
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH A SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WHEN IN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST AND MAY BUT THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE WOULD CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 AMID HIS IMMENSE EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MINE CRAZ WERE KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKED QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN EMBORNING DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSEING ENOUGH TO STOP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS NICHOLAS THE BROOMED HIM MAN WAS SATISFIED AND HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED HIS INANQUASY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
116-288047-0004 THE METHOD OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN IN INDIA HAS IN REPLACE BY ACTIVE INFORMATION CONCERN THE INDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MEANS HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS YOU SOMETH
116-288047-0007 THERE IS NO MAN OF FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS THAT I GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES UP BE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURB IN ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RHYTHMLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FEEL A SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FERRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE IN AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 COVER AT THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNDER WE HAVE REACHED THE EARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN TILL HE HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATES SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WHOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FACE OF MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL WAS THE BIRTH CLOSE AS SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION AS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE HAS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS THEY REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLAY OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WOULD DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COST IN THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWN TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED WITH A CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF VARIOUS TIMES AS A BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GUSS WAS GIVEN NO DATE AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN IN THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 MIGHT THIS DESCRIPTIONCY IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARIAN JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLAT TO EGYPT LUCS HAS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH QUEER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHY IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUSIFIXION IS COMMEMERATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VERY FREE TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUIONCE AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAG AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAKAN AUSTA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 THAT IN THE ACTIONS OF EVIDENCE ORIGIN OFFERS A FOLLY METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS FYPICAL SENSEES ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY METHODS AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEARED TO BE ON ANOTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUUS AND MERRY
116-288048-0013 THERE ISCTUALLY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH THE NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF AMATH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY WHAT WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUUS I'LL KEEP BY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN BY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 FOR THEY HAD BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 PALACE IS HIS UNANIMOUS SCIENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE ANNUMEROUS CANIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR THOSE
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE HE IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BUT A SWORD NOW AND BY HEALTH FAR HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN USE'S MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOER MY LEADERS TO CORNERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILD WAS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS MEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW ME SELF TO LIVE PROCESS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH POSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH APPROACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS RET TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YOU ASK EVERYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A REMNANT AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES CYNISTOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERING THINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR IMMEDIATE OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRUE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BUSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FULL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WOOL I HAVE ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMYER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLIGHTY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LYING AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS OLD THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY LONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 CHAPTER THREE
1255-138279-0009 FUL FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHEEP ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SOMEWHERE
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MUSCLE OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY SMALL WELL PULL
1255-138279-0014 THE WENDY STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THAT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLOOD SPOTING THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I LOSS WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 BUT I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 HOME MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE NONE
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DEAR ME WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO CLOSE I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACTOR IS I FORGOT TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHTE FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS APPROACH THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE KINDNESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE GATE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHE DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRLS BAKED FOR SOME TO DAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUEST TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE AT HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 YET THEY WILL PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 POTATOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAD HE LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS PLANT AND RESPECT TO HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FULL THE LEVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THEY PULLS ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE A MARRIED IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TROUBLE FROM ONE PAUL VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRIES IN FAVOR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF DEATH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOR MASTER AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEM MONSTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO MAKE YOUR LEGISIVE THAN ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISS AFRAID SO THAT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SAID THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE PULLS MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU ALREADY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE BURIED IN THAT LAST ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I SOON AS YOU DAWNED MY WORST STOCKING SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO FAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AN NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HAD NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG IT OUT OF SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RING GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIDE OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE REPLIED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD MAY ME WHEN I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU NAME ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK THAT
1255-90407-0006 HE WAS MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SOLVANIA COUNCIL ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER IS IS AS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIG A ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HADSA
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL WE MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS COPY ME FROM MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 S THAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE NEDS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JUST AFFORDED STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTEGUEWS TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPITALS
1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUMPMOUTH TIME IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THAT THAT WILL BE AT A HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN IVANT STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FALSE OF THE ATOMMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE SEATED HER BODILY BY INCERTING HER WASTE WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WANTED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR AMISSION LED IT TO THE WITHDRAWER OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TOLD AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANTS TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMEBODY TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT REVENISHLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRAWING HIS PLAY THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME STIPLES FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MATE SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ALMFUL OF WOMAN'S DREAMMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE ASLEEP MY GIRL SAID HYACINTH
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHAIN WHICH TO BE INITIATED JOIN THE BOOK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WHERE OF THIS ATTAR
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE LEAVE HIS CORA
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFYES
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINSGIVING'S EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FAITHFUL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT PART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 THOUGH THIS WAS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT VOUS HEBLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPOSITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALLMATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE DID NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIP SQUARE AND HE WENT THERE THOUGH WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIDY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SAID HONESTLY COST HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE BENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOOTHING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUSTICE THEY TURN MEDEERRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SAID THIS OLD EER HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTOR AND TWISTED ABOUT EM PUT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DIDY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH WOULD BE NEARLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SAT IN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY EAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LET MEAN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVAL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNS CIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT THEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY TUNNEL CLIFFS ALL THE NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JUSTICE IN PYSTON
1255-90413-0019 WELL DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE HEAVEN WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JUST HIM WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY AREIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICKLE UPON AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST TRAVELL
1255-90413-0024 AS HE HAD THE GUESTS STRUCK IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE THANTA EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THEPTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY AND JUSTICE LEFT WIFE OF A LAW TO JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTSIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMAL WORKMAN AND WAS CONCERNING HIS SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JUST IN TO RECOMMEND HIS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOE RAINING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENS THE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THE LANTERNS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING ON HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AND IT IS FRESH COST A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS A CHIEF THE INVENTION MAKES ITS A PAIR ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY A MATERIAL ARE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN THE WEIGHTS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT DISMISS THE APPARATUS A FORBID IS VERY USED
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR INATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALING THE INVENTION THE SEEKING THE HIGH A GOOD KNIT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD OF HER FACTION IF CONCYVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTRY PART AND INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A HOE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ECEPTIONS HAPPENED LEFT FAST
1585-131718-0007 YES THE VERY VOGO OF THE ELECTRY ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF APPARENT ARCHLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY VOCCAMIS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRENCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGLOSIDIC CONTRACTS FROM STREET LINENING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CURIOUS MANNER THE MONARD OF ELECTRILINEING WAS SEEN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST HIS SELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ATTICUM STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS DAY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY A MONSIEUR THAT ON TO THESE CONDITIONS THE MAUD LINING HUMP IS SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARTLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SORES OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAPPEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATTICON LINING COMPASS IN THE LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS VENUS GROUP
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST TENDER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GASMANAGEER DID NOT LIKE ARCHIED BUT IT INTERFERRED ONLY WITH HIS TREAT SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGE SOURCE OF INCOME BY ENEMIES
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVEZING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALL WAS CURIOUS WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ANIMOUS
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NO UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT IS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF CITIES THEY LET TRICK AND GAS PROMISE ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSHING THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINENCE
1585-131718-0018 A MOST CONSPIIGUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THE NEW YORK YOURSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THEY ARE WORK AS PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER AN ISSUES NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GRAY MANY COUNTS WERE EATEN AND RAT BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY EPATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARK AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DAM IN THE BALLAST AND WATERGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WOULD SHOW THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TWO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LAST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUGHT A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED WHEN OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A SLEW HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 AND THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH GAVE THE WORD NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INSTANTLY IT MAY BE DONE IT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO MEDICINE THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HERISON AND EMPORING THE CHINESE TRADER WHEN TO HIM INCH WANTED A DINAMO TO BE RUN BY HEN POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DINAMMOST ADDISONS APPEARED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROSE I WERE SON GO WERE SWEET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SECMUND BERDMAN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADAMSON UNTELLA FROM THE PARADISON FOONGRAPHS ANNE WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL IT IS THIS MORE WAY IN A LOFT YOUNG LUSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS A SCIENCE HAS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES HETERS FIFTY FUSS NUMEROUS OUT OF THE EAT HOUSE
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE ATASON ELECTURE LIGHT COMPANY LEAST A OD BEESIA NATION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEAD QUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMINENTER SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS WESTONSHIRE AVENUE TO COME WORSE
1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCED WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS FARTHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WISHED NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DONE TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOOD EXPLORING A RENT
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT PEARL OR FIVE YEAR SINCE IF I WAS A VERITABLE B HIGH DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY BEING ITS ARDONACLET OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING THE GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I SOUGHT THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER AN EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRES AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRIP
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THERE WAS OUT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MOTHER
1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER SOMETHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TO BUSY HER OTHER THINGS TO DENOISE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISAN SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREY VIOLINIST WAS RAMONY
1585-131718-0044 WHO WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLINE
1585-131718-0045 WHY NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS SMILING ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE IN NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HAT OF LONDON FIBRRY GATE
1585-131718-0048 WHO WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIVE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELL US STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORY IS AT THE HAIR IS IN THEM FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WONDER AND IT WAS ALL IN FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAND NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COAT
1585-131718-0052 THEN THE GOD BLURRRY SEEMED HAD TO BE SHAPED OF FLORA TO PROCURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF INTEREST AND DISSIPATION AND THE PARENTOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING ELLISON'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS RETIRED
1585-157660-0000 LINCOLN IS GOAT AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MAN ARE VOTED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE O STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRAYING ROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICO FASHION AND UTTER THE FALLING ORATORICAL FLOOD
1585-157660-0003 GLAORIES LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SOUND A THING THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT THE VASTAGE OF THIS ONE OF HER MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WAFT BAT AND BEAT HIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE HURT AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDING DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S HEAVEN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS FOURS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNYED COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WELL AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIDE BOTTOMS LAYING IF IN FOING ARMS AND MORPHORUS UNTO THE POT OF KNOCK AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NIGHT
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIDE OF THE SUN RISINGLAND OF GIFTS GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXHITATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPECTATION FASTENED AND MOST OFF THERE WERE MOST A PROMISES AND OFF A HEADS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS
1585-157660-0009 DEUCEOUS ONE DOUBLE WHEN SIX IS TROPICALLY
1585-157660-0010 WELL INTO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DILLER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CINIPOT WHICH WERE IMMEDIATELY KEPT BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS TO LOOK AT ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION

1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SENT MY LIFE UPON THE CAST I WILLWITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH A LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF ENGLAND BOO PERHAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JUMPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RCIPROCO
1585-157660-0015 THE PRINTING SHOP OF FOUL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL WAS TAVEN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES ROBYGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORMER WILLIAM AND BLURRY OUT IN HIS GLOVEMANER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY REASON TRAVELLS IN THE BEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND IN EFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENED NOW BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN PATH IN THE HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE INFANT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT THE MUTILATED MUCH CHEERED OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMOTIONAL AND POLITICAL TREADMENT
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLEEVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS MORES TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BID ITS MORES ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUST FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSE US A SMART RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY CRIED A TRUE LAUGH OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT APIC OF THE CELL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHAPARDA GIVES US A PLENTIFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 THEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDRE CAME HUMANITY WAS CHARGED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS ARTEMO'S DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HOUNDENED INTO AN AGE OF A NOTE CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED AT ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER MIGHT THE NEXT TROUBLE LAW OF EXPLOSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS IT MANY QUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURALLY AND AH AND HOW MANY WITH THOSE VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 MY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GREAT OFTEN INALASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HELDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LULLS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A PALMAN AND PACIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOMENTING CIRCUMSTANCE TO BEAR AN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MOSTRING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING US CHIEFS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY INAUDO ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY LITTLE BE INCAPABLE OF HURTING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND A FIGHTING AND FREEDOM SCHOOLS
1630-102884-0016 EACH HAD PRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF THE NOTION WHICH HAS TO A PURERANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUE AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY THOUGH WITH TEN ITS BONE FREECE AND OUTSIDE

1630-141772-0004 LIFT THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRIED HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TATABLE BEING OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE STRUCTURE THE JOLTING RIGHT BEING MOVED AND THE CLOTHING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 YETING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK

1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF CHRISTMAS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SAD SATISFACTION AND LEISURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHERE HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICON PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOUR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY KNOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED WHEN THE LITTLE EYE CON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN ZADIG APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE TO KNOW THAT TO SEEK WHO HAVE IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GLEAM
