116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MY
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLIDING TO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GUIDE
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CAN OF THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AND IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPPED GOD THEY DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS UP PROTESTED MY HEART CLAM MADE MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO I SAID IN A LOUD VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDLE THEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 HE MADE AFENS A SEA OF LIGHT HE CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTROPPED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS CHANCE WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 PRODUC HIM
116-288045-0015 I WISHED TO MYSELF WHAT BLESS FOR ME
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNED THE DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HOR
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOR THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO WAS NOT AN IDLE
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND HIS SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN AND GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOW AND KNEELING BEFORE THEIR VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEAN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT A PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH HIS OBJECTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY IN IDLE
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWER INTO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNED TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 WOULD HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WOULD HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHAL THE EMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER IN MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE USE AS MUCH OF AN IDLE AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH AN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT DISEASES BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CAN A DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLENITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERY THING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILT UP IS ANOTHER CHRISTIAN ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OR PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASSERING TRUTH AND A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF A STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRINAL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS FORWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR WRITES POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELLING WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISHED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 THE FIRSTLESS BE IMPERSONAL METHODS IRREVERENT BLASSUMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG IN A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM IN B
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH A SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WENT IN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST AND MAY BUT THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE WHAT CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 AMID HIS ESSENTIAL EXCLAMATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MINE CRAZ WERE KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD HAS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN EMBORNING DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS NICHOLAS THE BROOMED HIM MAN WAS SATISFIED AND HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED HIS INADEQUASY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALISATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN IN INDIA HAS IN REPLACE BY ACTIVE INFORMATION CONCERN THE HINDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MAKES HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS OF
116-288047-0007 THERE IS AN MAN OF FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS AND I GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURB IN ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RHYTHMLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FEEL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE IN AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 RECOVERED THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNDER WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN TILL MEN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATED SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FACE OF MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL IS THE BIRTH PLACE AS SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGIOUS IS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WOULD DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COST IN THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED WITH A CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF VARIOUS TIMES AS A BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSS WAS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORNE ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 MIGHT HIS DESCRIPTION SEE IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARIAN JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED TO EGYPT LOOPS HAS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COUNT THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHY IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUSIFIXION IS COMMEMERATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VERY FEW OF A YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUALANCE AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAG AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PA CAN AUSTAIA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 THAT IN THE ACTIONS OF EVIDENCE ORGAN OFFERS A FOLLY METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS HYPICAL SENSEES ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEARED TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW IT WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDUUS AND MERRY
116-288048-0013 THERE HAS ACTUALLY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW WAS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MITH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE HE SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUICE I'LL KEEP BY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHILE THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 ALICE IS HIS UNANIMOUS SIGNS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE ANNUMEROUS CANADATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE HE IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BUT A SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FAR HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUGE'S MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VERTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOER MY LEADERS TO QUARTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TODAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS THEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF TO LIVE PROCESS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSE BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH APPROACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS RE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 WHAT HE SAID IF YOU ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHERE HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A ROMAN AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSABLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES CYNISTOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR IMMEDIATE OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BUSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FULL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WOOL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMYER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL GLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT THEREAFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THAT IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THEY SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WAS SPOKEN ALLOWED ONE
1255-138279-0008 TWO TWO THREE
1255-138279-0009 FULL FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A THOUSAND YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MOSSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WELL POLE
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOWS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLOOD SPOT ON THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I OFF WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 WELL I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 HO MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE MANY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO COULSON I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO US
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD KNIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS ARRANGEMENT THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE CONTEST NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NIGHT WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEKED FOR SOME TO DAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THE REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDEED HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WILL PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT AT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 POTATOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAD HE LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS PLANT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FULL THE LEVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THERE PULLS ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MARRIED IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TROUBLE FROM ONE PAUL VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRIES IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOR MASTER AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MONSTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO MAKE YOUR LEGISIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISS AFRAID SOME THAT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GUNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY A FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 HAVE YOU READY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE WANT TO BE MARRIED IN ALAS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I SOON AS YOU DAWNED MY WORSTED STOCKING SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO HAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AN THOU I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HAD NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG OUT OF SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGHT OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE CALLED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD MAY ME WHAT I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK SIR
1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SOLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS AS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HAD SO
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL HIM MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS COATING ME FROM MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 AS THAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE KNITS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JUST AFFORDED STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MULTIBUS TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPITALS
1255-90407-0016 NOW I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUMPBOTH TIME IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THAT THAT WILL BE AT A HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WILL YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN IVENT STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE SEATED HER BODILY BY INSERTING HOW WASTE WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWER OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOSE SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TOLD AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANTS TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT ROUGHENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRAWING HIS PLAY THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME STIPLES FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MATE SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S DREAMMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE ASLEEP MY GIRL SAID JASON
1255-90407-0028 HE A GAME BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHAIN WHICH TO BE INITIATED JOIN THE BOOK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WHERE OF THIS ATARE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE LEAVE HIS CARRO
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS PLACE AND SATISFYS
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PIN DAVID'S EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FAITHFUL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT PART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 THAT THIS WAS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT VOUS HEEL
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GET FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE DID NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THERE THOUGH WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIDY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SAID HONESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE BENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SUITKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUSTICE THEY TURN MEDEERA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SAID THIS OLD EER HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTOR AND TWISTED ABOUT EM PUT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DEBTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH WOULD BE NEARLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SAT IN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE WANINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE MEAN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER ON CIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT DEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY JOHN CLIFFS ALL THE NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSEPH AND PIESTON
1255-90413-0019 WHO DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE NAME WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JUSTIN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WITTH'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY ALLIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAND LIGHT NICKLE UPON AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST RIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS HE OF THE GUESTS STRUCK IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FANTAS EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE AUTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JUSTICE LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTSIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMAN AND WAS CONCERNING HIS SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JUSTLY TO RECOMMEND HIS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOE RINGING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENS THE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THEY ENTERS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING ON HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE THAT IT IS FRESHLY COST A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS A CHIEF THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY A MATERIAL ARE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT DISMISSED THE APPARAGES A FORBID IS VERY USED
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY ARE INATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWING THE INVENTION THE SEEKING THE HIGH A GOOD KNIT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TROUBLE TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD OF HER FACTION IF CONCYVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLACE SALUTRY PART AND INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A HOE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ECEPTIONS HAPPY LEFT FAST
1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGO OF THE ELECTRY ARTLIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENTS ARCHLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY VOCCAMIS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRENCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGLOSIDIC CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINENING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CURIOUS MANNER THE MONARD OF ELECTRI LINE WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST HIS SELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ATTICON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY A MONSIEUR THAT ON TO THESE CONDITIONS THE MAUD LINING HUMP IS SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCONESCENT AND ARTLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SORES OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OWN FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAPPEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATTICON MINING COMPASS IN THE LEADING CITIZEN
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDOUS GROUP
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST PETER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GASMANAGEER DID NOT LIKE ARCHIED BUT IT INTERFERRED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HAS LARGE A SOURCE OF INCOME BY ENEMIES
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALL WAS CURIOUS WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ANIMOUS
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NO UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT IS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HAUNTERS OF CITIZEN THEY LET TRICK AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSHING THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINENCE
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPIIGUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THE NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THEY ARE WORKSPLENDY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER AN ISSUES NOT EQUAL TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE UDO
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GRAY MANY COUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND RAT BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY EPATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARK AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DIM AND THE BALLAST AND WATERGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WOULD SELL THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TWO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY OUT IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LAST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUGHT A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING ROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORD NICELY
1585-131718-0028 EVIDENTLY IT MAY BE DONE IT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO MEDICINE THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HERISON AND EMPORING THE CHINESE TRADER WHEN TO HIM INCH WANTED AS DINAMO TO BE RUN BY HEN POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOUS ADDISONS APPEARED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROSE I WERE SON GO WHERE STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SECMUND BERDMAN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADAMSON UNTELLA FROM THE PARADISON FOONGRAPHS ANNE WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL IT IS THIS MORE WAY IN A LOFT YOUNG LUSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS A SCIENCE HAS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES HETERS FIFTY FUSES NUMEROUS OUT OF EACH HOUSE
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE ATASON ELECTURE LIGHT COMPANY LEAST A OD BEESIA NATION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEAD QUARTERS AND SHOW RIMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND HIS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONDR SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS WESTONSHIRE AVENUE TO COME WORSE
1585-131718-0033 THEY EXPERIENCED WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS FURTHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DONE TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A RENT
1585-131718-0035 THE NEXT PEARL FIVE YEAR SIX IF I WAS A VERITABLE B HIGH DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY BEING ITS ARDANACWOOD OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING THE GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER AN EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRESS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE UP WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THAT WAS OUT
1585-131718-0040 I FELT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I ALWAYS TO BUSY HER OTHER THINGS TO DENOTIC
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISAN SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREY VIOLINIST WAS RAMINEY
1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0045 WHY NOT HE CAME WITH HIS FIRING ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AS SIXTY FIVE LATE IN NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINGS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HAT OF LONDON IN FIBURY GATE

1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF INTEREST AND DISSIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING ABSENCE'S EXPERIMENTS

1630-102884-0000 IN MY REASON TRAVELLES IN THE BEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND IN EFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENED NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY HAVE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN PART IN THE HANDS
1630-102884-0003 AS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE BEST

1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT APIC OF THE CELL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHAPARDA GIVES US A PLENTIFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FOR OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUUDRE CAME HUMANITY WAS CHARGED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS ARTEMO'S DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HOUNDENED INTO AN AGE IF A NOTE CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED IT ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER MIGHT BE NEXT TROUBLE LAW OF EXPLOSION
