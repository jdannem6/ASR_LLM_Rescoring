5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE SOVEREIGNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDION OF OUR POLITICAL BRIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNES THIS PHYSICIAN HAS COME TO HEARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WARZARD BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF THE SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEEDED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE TRARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THAT CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNEDS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED

5849-50873-0017 MEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME MUCH SOON NOR TO READ
5849-50873-0018 THE FUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
5849-50873-0019 CALM CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR MEASURE

5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOD IS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USE BY THE SECRETARYS IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOURLIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE IN TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATION NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOW THE FAINT STAR LIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS ABRUPTLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSED BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE USED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 THOUGH I HAD A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN THE CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN ROSWORTH THE TRAINED DANCE CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHILD

5849-50873-0032 COON OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRY THE ENGLISH GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLYS SHOOK THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE WHO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVING TO MANTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFULISTS IN DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARD KNOWN AS CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED THE GRASS SPARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FROM THE CAESAR OF THE CHARTIVES WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN A ASSEMBLY ROYALS SENT A MOST LOYAL AGUS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMERLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE AND ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMAN ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FOUR UNION OF THE COLONIES FROM MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH IN INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RAILROAD ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENCE OF EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMEND CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS I DONEIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAMS WAR SOON AFTER THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BUTT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BRIGHAM TO MISTER MONTRY AND SHE IS A VERY HEAVY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 TO THIS CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROPEFUL CABLE
5849-50962-0003 WHAT'S THAT BOARD FOR ASKED BRUTE AS HE SAW A BOARD FOLLOWING THE KEEL
5849-50962-0004 THAT'S THE DIRECTIONS SAID HALL
5849-50962-0005 THEY ARE PRINTED IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE FRUIT CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP TO THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BIRD THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BULLY WILL GO OUT ON A POLLY
5849-50962-0007 THAT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS IN WOMEN INTO THE BEACH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS ROBSEY MISSUS LYNDETERN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND MAN WERE ALL THERE FLASSY AND FRETTY BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH'S SEASON
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND CERTAIN HOW TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIMEY FOR ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CAVING SHOWED THAT THE BOY WAS RETURNING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME TILL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMAN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND BELLY CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG RULER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE BIRDS AND A MAN IN THE COURT BOAT BOUNDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NULLING WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MEN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FOLLY RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DRIMMED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND AS GEORGE BRING HIM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASK THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME OFFICER

5849-50962-0021 HERE COME ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIGIAN DASHED ON SINS
5849-50962-0022 WHILE I DECLARE WE DID LAND OF A FRIENDLY SHORE

5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN UP OF THE DREADFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 BUT EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NECK TEAM THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A STEAMER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT THE LENAS SO
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY WHILE GLOWED ON A SCHOONER AND WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE TENTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER BARSY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALET REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WHILE I AM A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE A CLOCKLAN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIGHT TIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN THE SHEER
5849-50963-0011 MAYBE ON EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOP THING TOUR SUGGESTED MAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERK TO MOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE ALES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FAITH AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BY TO YOU NOW HE TOLD DORTHY AND THEN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NEAR
5849-50964-0002 WE'RE QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DORKY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDARRELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DORGY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC BLOCKLAIN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NEAR HE TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE I THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BURT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I'M WILLING TO GO TO WORK THEN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED THE MAN THE OCCASION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FRETTY AND GLOSSY WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NATS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNEAKED THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THE VEXATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTER IS GET DRUNK WILL GO MATTER WITH JEALOUSY O FULL IN EPLECTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DARSKI HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINBER
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A ELEVATED TORTURE
6123-59150-0003 SUDDENLY THE LAST OF CRUELTY THE LAST DESTRUCTION OF THE DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SCENES IN DUSTAYSK IS MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL ORCER
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY NEVER ENVELOPE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LOST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVIL THE LOST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 GASTASKEY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NECKCLADEL IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CHRIST SOME ONE IN THEODIOUS
6123-59150-0009 ONE RESORT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN TO TALK IS ALL ACTIONS MORE THAN HER IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW HIS GALLANT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LOST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW VAGUE CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND ATTEND AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK GAME TANED HIS EYES HEAVEN WOODS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CROSS'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTAERSKI OR A NOT MERIT DOES TO ESKI
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN INCORENNA O FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHISE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADER THAT A SPELL THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGIN OF INTENSITY AND PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGANATUS AND ABNORMAL CHARACTERALTON
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES HIS DICKENS EVENTS COMMIT GREATESTS
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BEARING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE CARAVANS OF THEMSELVES HE BETRAYED THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BROMANIAX
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM WRITE SHOUTED MAJOR BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY JUSTICE HE HAS BECOME A POPULAR ORA
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODONISTS EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTACHE IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THE ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CART IS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A PENSION PRINCE S ATDOLATA IVANOVNA LIZIDA PROCCOPHIADONSKI OF GLOGRATONSKI A PRINCESS BERLOQUINNSKI VERGLAYA PRINCE MISSAN COLYAPOGAN IPOOLITA DANIA CHISSENKA DANIATSON AND GENERAL OFOGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SACRED OF DUSTY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE IN THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MERRY BOLDLY FACES A DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM JUSTICE ITS WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFLEGUTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN CABIN SAT IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO NO
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY HAVE POSSESSED THEY HAD NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN MEASURE TRUE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT OF CONTENT OF DUSTY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL IS AT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN JEALOUSYSKI A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GUARD THAN THE TABLES
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DUSTERESKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PATUS LORD I BELIEVE HOPE THOU MIGHT UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT THUS HE STILL SEIZED THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS BUT PRINCE MISSION IN THE IDEAS
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE DARES THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE NOBLES ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THIS MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VACUNDED VOGAY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH OF POLICE COURT WAITING TRIAL OR AMONG BAG OF ONES HE PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SHOWN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD STVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT'S A PORTRAIT OF THE MEN ONE SEES BEHIND DLSKI'S NOBLES THE PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOBLES
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPUFFELS
6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT BUT TEMPERAMENT TO SINGHAM
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORE
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HAUGHTY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS ARE AN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE RITS IN I FOUND HER AT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THEY COULD NOT BE AN UGLY AND MORE PRESAIC AT SUCH DURATION THIS CONTAINED IN THE AGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PRISING SHREWDS IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WAY DOMICILE IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME CALM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE ARE STRANGERS SORT THAT CAITTERING CARE LOUD SMILES BESPOKE THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CARTERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS A LINE OF OLD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NONE YET LOST THE LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE AND THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR YOUR LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GREGG DIE WHEN AS THE HAIR BELL STRUCK ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THEIR HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF THE REPROACHRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASE IS LUCK IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE ALL STROKED ITS SONG A DISCOURSE THAT BRING HAD TUMBLED INTO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT RIGHT AS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER PAUL OFF THE PALM OF HIS WITH THE FAME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HAUGHTY TOO LATE CHRISTIANIA THE MOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE IN THE BOSTON TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF CHILDHOOD THERE IS IN BROWNIE'S TRAGEDYS
6123-59186-0016 HIS WILL IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF PROPERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED IT FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BURNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARTER'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED THE HOTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD LEARNLY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH ECONIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE POT STILLS LET'S POT ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FREDGILE FRAME AT EVES WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF LONELY TO HIDERY'S POEMS THE OXEN
