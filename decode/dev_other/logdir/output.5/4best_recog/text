5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HIT HERSELF ON LATCH GUARD AIR AND JEALOUS LITTLE SOUL
5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LAACHO
5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS AND SARAPHY MALICS AND GERVINUS HAD AS SHE APPROACHED LAACHA

5543-27761-0105 SARAH FEMALEX AND JERMUS STOOD A ERECT SIDE IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CAUGHT LOUDLY WILLACHA
5543-27761-0106 WHILE WATCH GOES BEING CARRIED OUT
5849-50873-0000 CAPTAIN BULL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SEABROKE PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BOTH ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT

5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WATSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LATELY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE SOVEREIGNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL BRIDES
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNES THIS VICTORY HAS COME TO HEARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN POYSER BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF THE SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NICE SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN HEEDED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAKE THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED IN THE FATE
5849-50873-0010 AND WILL HE WAIT UNTIL RESENTED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO

5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME MUCH SOON NOR TO READ
5849-50873-0018 THE SON WAS SITTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
5849-50873-0019 COMMON CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR COMMISSION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PRINCE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN WATSWORTH
5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOD IS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES FOR PLACE ON THE TABLE IN TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATION HEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOW THE FAINT STARETTE DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 SHE FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CALLED BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 THOUGH I HAVE I CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN THE CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WASWORTH THE TRAIN ADVANCE CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHIRNOR
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HEAR OF THE TRAIN BANDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 COO OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIES THE ENGLISH GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLIES SHOOK THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE WHO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVING CANNETICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFULNESS AND DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS TO CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED THE DRESS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FROM THE CAESAR OF THE CHARTIVES WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN A ASSEMBLY ROYALS SENT A MOST LOYAL ACTRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMERLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FIRST UNION OF THE COLONIES FROM MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH IN INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF ROAD ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENCE OF EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMEND CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS HAD DONEIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAMS WAR SOON AFTER THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BET WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHONER SAID MISTER BRIGHAM TO MISTER MANTRY AND SHE IS A VERY HEAVY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 TO THIS CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROPER CABLE
5849-50962-0003 WHAT'S THAT BOARD FOR ASKED BRIG AS HE SAW ABOARD FOLLOWING THE KEEL
5849-50962-0004 THAT'S THE DIRECTION SAID HOW
5849-50962-0005 THEY ARE PRINTED IN THE NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE CREW TO CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP TO THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BURNT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BULLY WILL GO OUT ON A POLLY
5849-50962-0007 WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS IN THEM INTO THE BEACH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS ROBSY MISSUS MINTERN NELLY AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND MAN WERE ALL THERE FLASSY AND FRETTY BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH'S SEASON
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BURTON HOW TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME FOR ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BOY WAS RETURNING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER I CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMAN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NILLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE BIRDS AND A MAN IN THE COURT BOAT BANDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND ANDNELLING WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT IN THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DRINED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND HAS GEORGE BRING HIM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAN THE WELCOME ANSWER
5849-50962-0020 I GUESS OUR PRAYERS WERE HERE LAST NIGHT
5849-50962-0021 HERE COME ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED ON SAMS
5849-50962-0022 WHILE I DECLARED WE DID LAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BRIGHAM SAID THE LIE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING MILLY'S FATHER AND HOWL'S UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 AND HOW ON HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN THE MAN
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MOURNING THAT WAS AT SUNSET BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLASSY TO FRETIE WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
5849-50963-0000 THE BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE DREADFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 AND EVERYTHING WAS SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NAP TEAM THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SANDPAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF US CREW TOOK A FEVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELYNA'S SO
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY WHILE GLOWED ON THE SCHONER AND WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DREW US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER HOBBSY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN A SIDE SO THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WHILE I AM A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE A BLOCKLAN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT HAS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE SHAKEN US A LIKE TIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN THE SHEER
5849-50963-0011 LADY AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOP THING TOUR SUGGESTED MAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS TO MOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE ISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTEN THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACE AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE YOU NOW YOU TOLD DORTHY AND THEN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED ME
5849-50964-0002 YOU'RE QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REPLIED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DORKING WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDARALA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOORKY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS NEW BLOCKLAIN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TWO NOW HE TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BIRT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VOCATION AND I'M WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED MAN THE PATIENT WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FRETTY AND CLOTHSY WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNAKED THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VEXATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTER IS GET DRUNK WILL GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY O FULL INAPLETIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSESKI HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STINBER
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS INEVITABLED TORTURE
6123-59150-0003 SUDDENLY THE LAST OF CRUELTY THE LOST DESTRUCTION OF THE DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SCENES AND DUSTAYSK IS MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL OR OTHER
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICTS
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LOSS IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LOST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTASKEY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NECKCLADEL IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CHRIST SOME ONE IN THEIDIOUS
6123-59150-0009 MY RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN A TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OUR IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SO HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LOST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BADE CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND ATTEND AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK GAME TANED HIS EYES HEAVEN WOODS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERENTLY GOOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTAIRSKI OR A NOT MERIT DOES TO NISKI
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIMEAN PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ACORENNA O FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THAT A SPELL THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY IN PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGEANATUS AND ABNORMAL CHARACTERALTY
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES HIS DICKENS EVENTS COMMIC GREATESTS
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BURIED THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE CARAVANS OF THEMSELVES HE BETRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIAX
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT ADDED MAJOR BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM O'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOES CHANCE HE HAS BECOME A POPULAR ORA
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIC EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTACHES ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CART IS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A PENSION PRINCE S ATDOLATA IVANOVNA LIZIDA PROCCOPHIADONSKI OF GLOGRATONSKI A PRINCESS BERLOQUINNSKI VERGLAYA PRINCE MISSAN COLYAPOGAN IPOOLITA DANIA CHISSENKA DANIA CHISON AND GENERAL OF OGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SACRED OF DUSTIER'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MOST ACUTE IN THRILL OF ITS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER NEWBERRY BOLDLY FACES A DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS A DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM JUST ASK ITS WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFLEGUTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MAIN CABIN SAT IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY HAD POSSESSED THEY UNDER LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN IMAGINE SURE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT OF CONTENT OF JUSTICE IS WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL IS AT BATTLES OF DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOCAYSKI A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GUARD THAN TO TABLES
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF STASKI IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PATUS LORD I BELIEVE HOPE THOU MIGHT UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT GROTESQUE HE STILL SEIZED THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS BUT PRINCE MISCHIEF IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE WEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE NOBLES ARE THE PROPHET IMAGE OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICUNDED VOLGAE DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED HER A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT A WAITING TRIAL OR AMONG BAG OF ONES HE PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SHAME ON THE IMAGES OF OLD STAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT'S THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DLSPIA'S NOVELS THE PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOBLES
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELLLS
6123-59186-0000 HE HAS NOT BUT TEMPERAMENT TO SINGNA
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STONE
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARVEY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ACTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LAUGH EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WOODS OR AN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE RITS IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THEY COULD NOT BE AN UGLY AND MORE PRESAIC AT SUCH DURATION THESE CONTAINED IN THE AGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PRISING TRUTHS IN THE CHOICE OF WORLD AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WEDDING DOMICILE IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME CALM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE HIS STRANGERS SORT THAT KATETERING CARE LOUD SMILES BESPOKE THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 KATETERING CARE IS IN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS A LINE OF BLUE POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NONE YET LOST THE LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE AND THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVER BEAR RELUCTANCE FOR YOUR LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GREGG DIE WHEN AS THE HAIR BELL STRUCK ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF THE POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASE IS LUCK IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE ALL STROKED ITS SONG A DISCOURSE THAT WERE HAD TUMBLED INTO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSATION BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT RIGHTUS TO THE PAIN IMPASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER PAUL OFF THE PALM OF HIS WITH THE FAME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HAUGHTY TOO LATE CHRISTIANIA THE MOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE IN THE DUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWN'S TRAGEDYS
6123-59186-0016 HIS ROAD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED IT FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED THE HEARTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD LEARNLY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH ECONIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE POT STILLS LET'S POT ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVES WITH THROBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF LONELY TO HARDY'S POEMS THE OXEN
