1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A DOMESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PURITANICAL PAPER WHICH SHE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS A TO LOSS HOW TO NATIVE IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN OF NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMPD TOGETHER IN HIS AWED A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE FACT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S OBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING DESOLATE
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS EGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINEING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOU FEEL AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONORS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KIND OF PRAISE PURSUES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCY IN MADHOOD
1651-136854-0012 GRAY
1651-136854-0013 SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS REPELLED MY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY WOULD TURN
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY INDEED COMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND ENEMY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD AND EACH TO PRIVATE INTERESTING TO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIORS EVERYONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITIES EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED EXCUSE EVER WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MADE YOU AGAINST FIVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO DRAWN IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORE ALREADY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GOD AND EXCITEMENT AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERV THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USEFUL WISE AND INNOCENT AND THE DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HOLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBID TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENYS YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACTIVE VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SORTING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIMES SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RENT OF STOICISM AS THE SONG OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENSES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRETIES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABYLON TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHTISH RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTO WOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
