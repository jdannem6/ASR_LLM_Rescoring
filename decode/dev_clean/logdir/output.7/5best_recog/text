6319-275224-0000 WHAT A FUSSERS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY AT ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVOUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE COOL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO EXORIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS ON THE WOODS
6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLICK ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY AND WHOSE REFINED YEAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
6319-275224-0007 HE REALLY AGREED TO SEE IT
6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSED THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST COMPLICATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
6319-275224-0009 INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOLVULOUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
6319-275224-0012 MEANWHILE HOW BARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
6319-275224-0013 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FUR PULL
6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AND FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELED HER TO THE DIRT
6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WALK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
6319-275224-0016 BUT FOR THE SAKE THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION RANGED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
6319-275224-0018 THE MISTRESS HAD RETURN AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
6319-275224-0019 IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HIS SHOULDER
6319-275224-0020 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TYE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DECAYION AND HE WAS THE SON OF POMETHEUS
6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMMETHEUS ON MOUNT CARCASES AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES UNDER THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
6319-57405-0002 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS NIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND RAVING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT DECAYIAN THE SON OF PERMETHEIUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
6319-57405-0005 THE DAY IS COMING SAID POLYTHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
6319-57405-0006 BUT TO CALION AND PERRA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
6319-57405-0007 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISHES HE ASKED
6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID CANADIAN TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MURKERY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PERIL
6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID CANADIAN
6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SAVE THEM
6319-64726-0000 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING THESE A LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
6319-64726-0001 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF IN THE LITTLE BABY LAND AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
6319-64726-0002 THE CHARM OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
6319-64726-0003 IT IS TRUE I CAN ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
6319-64726-0004 NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAD AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING BUT SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S ZADIG
6319-64726-0005 SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND THANKED AWAY
6319-64726-0006 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWOKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
6319-64726-0007 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
6319-64726-0008 THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FILLED HIMSELF ON FIRE
6319-64726-0009 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETTABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
6319-64726-0010 HE ENTERED A LARGE FORE CORD AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE
6319-64726-0011 BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPPEDS OF WINE LEFT
6319-64726-0012 HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LYING WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
6319-64726-0013 HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING
6319-64726-0014 I HAD WAITED LONG FOR YOU
6319-64726-0015 THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND AT NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
6319-64726-0016 MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN AWAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXCEEDINGLY HUNGRY
6319-64726-0017 THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED A PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
6319-64726-0018 THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLEDOUR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
6319-64726-0019 THE VIOLINS AND HOBOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMANOR MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS AND THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE
6319-64726-0020 HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE COUNCIL BUT BEHOLD
6345-64257-0000 WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEIE AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
6345-64257-0001 AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROW WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED A LIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE IN THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IF FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE
6345-64257-0002 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BINNY UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
6345-64257-0003 SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAPE
6345-64257-0004 THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECOVER IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY
6345-64257-0005 SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE OR SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
6345-64257-0006 IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUTER WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND ODORS
6345-64257-0007 BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDER ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
6345-64257-0008 AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOMMS
6345-64257-0009 SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDING HER
6345-64257-0010 SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN EXTERNAL LOSS
6345-64257-0011 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NOR WHAT SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
6345-64257-0012 BUT LIVING SOLD THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET
6345-64257-0013 SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE NEW HIM
6345-64257-0014 HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO WEEPING
6345-64257-0015 I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO GAKING
6345-64257-0016 THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECOME MORE SHADOWY
6345-64257-0017 HER ONLY LIFE WAS BUT SHE WAS LOST
6345-64257-0018 SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST OF FUM FROM MY OWN BRAIN
6345-64257-0019 THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE OR DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
6345-64257-0020 WE THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
6345-93302-0000 SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM A YRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS
6345-93302-0001 HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUE BELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE AND MAIDENLY FENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
6345-93302-0002 YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW TRUST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEAKLY JOURNALS
6345-93302-0003 SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING IN HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SINCE
6345-93302-0004 AND VARIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
6345-93302-0005 SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE GINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER
6345-93302-0006 THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORTANCE
6345-93302-0007 IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
6345-93302-0008 HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO ACCUSE NO EXPLANATION
6345-93302-0009 BUT HERE THE ONLY THINGS THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
6345-93302-0010 THE KEEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN OUTSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
6345-93302-0011 HER ARMS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD
6345-93302-0012 SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK TOWER
6345-93302-0013 SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY CULPED IT IS
6345-93302-0014 AND YESTERDAY HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECTED TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING
6345-93302-0015 A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER HOPE THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
6345-93302-0016 WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM A THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
6345-93302-0017 FOLLOWING THE TINGE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
6345-93302-0018 I DON'T WONDER YOU ARE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS N'T IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
6345-93302-0019 THOSE FORTY TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
6345-93302-0020 COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
6345-93302-0021 DO YOU THINK I'RE NOT SORRY NOW
6345-93302-0022 NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOAT OF US
6345-93302-0023 I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HUM AND GLOWED OVER IT ALL
6345-93302-0024 HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DID YOU MEAN IT
6345-93302-0025 ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THRILL ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS
6345-93302-0026 AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWUING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT
6345-93302-0027 AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK IN REMEDY THAT EAR
6345-93302-0028 HE CHECKED THE SOLI IMPULSE
6345-93302-0029 SO HE HAD LISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDTLES AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
6345-93306-0000 THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED AND TOMAZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TWOS OF ITS REPATORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSE MADE AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
6345-93306-0001 THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FOOL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE
6345-93306-0002 THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVELE
6345-93306-0003 AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET MEASURE
6345-93306-0004 NEVER AT ANY ACT SEEM SO IMPOSSIBLE
6345-93306-0005 THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GUARD AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED
6345-93306-0006 THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL WISHES
6345-93306-0007 LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THERES SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT
6345-93306-0008 DO DRINKNESS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
6345-93306-0009 HE HURRIEDLY CUT KATE AND PRESSED IT UPON HER
6345-93306-0010 HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO HIM
6345-93306-0011 IT'S ONLY THAT YOUR POOR WELL THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TO SHE LAUGHED
6345-93306-0012 HER LITTLE FOOT TAPPED THE GRAVELL IMPATIENTLY
6345-93306-0013 HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE AND MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT
6345-93306-0014 SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE MIND

6345-93306-0016 LET ME THINK HE SAID HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPEN TO COME THIS WAY
6345-93306-0017 I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS IN WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
6345-93306-0018 I WILL CATCH THE KNIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN YOU WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
6345-93306-0019 YOU SEE PAPA SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECTED ME TOO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED
6345-93306-0020 IT WASN'T I WHO SAW THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED

6345-93306-0022 YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND UP TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY

6345-93306-0024 THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BANDRO GIRLS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE CELLAR BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE

652-130726-0001 THOMPSON OPENED A LARGE RESTAURANT IN A FERUL STREET JUST ABOVE PHILMORE AND FOR TWO YEARS OR MORE DID A THRIVING BUSINESS HIS PLACE BEING NOTED FOR ITS GOOD COOKING AND ITS SPLENDID SERVICE
652-130726-0002 ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHIL TISON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURN DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DELMONTI IN PAUL STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER
652-130726-0003 HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLOQUEUAL DEFINITION OF CABARET
652-130726-0004 HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THEATER HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALLS
652-130726-0005 THIS GARGISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF CEILING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ABODE OF SATURNALIA BUT DECORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS

652-130726-0015 IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FEATURES AND TO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT
652-130726-0016 THE FLY TRAP AND CHARLEY'S FASHION THE FIRST ENSUDER STREET NEAR CURANING AND THE OTHER IN MARKET NEAR SUITTER SERVE WELL COOKED FOODS ESPECIALLY SOUP SALADS AND FISH

652-130726-0034 UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE BABYLON IS TOUGH AND UNALATABLE BUT AFTER THE DEAF MANIPULATION OF HERBERT THEY ARE TENDER AND MAKE A FINE DISH EITHER FRIED AS CHATTER OR ALL IN NEWBERG
652-130726-0035 IN ADDITION TO BABYLONIES THE HOSTILE MAKES A SPECIALTY OF A LITTLE ORGAN PROFFISH
652-130737-0000 NEVER DRINK ANY HARD LIQUORS SUCH AS WHISKEY BRANDY GIN OR COCKTAILS WITH OYSTERS OR CLAMS AS IT IS LIABLE TO UPSET YOU FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING

777-126732-0000 ALL ADOZATION MAKES LIFE POOR
777-126732-0001 AND WHY INDULGING PROPHETIC FANTASIES
777-126732-0002 AT BEST THEY CAN ONLY INTERPRET THE MIND OF THE PROFIT AND CAN HAVE NO OBJECT OF VALUE
777-126732-0003 MY PALACE THE TICKET OF LEAP APOSTLE WAS SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE A VOICE THAT WEEZED AS IF DEADENED AND OPPRESSED BY THE LAYER OF FAT ON HIS CHEST
777-126732-0004 AND EVER SINCE HE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO GET HIS WAY DOWN AS MUCH AS ANNOUNCED
777-126732-0005 WITH HIS ELBOW PRESENTING NO APPEARANCE OF A JOINT BUT MORE LIKE A BEND THAN A DUMMY'S LIMB THROWN OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR HE LEANED FORWARD SLIGHTLY OVER HIS SHORT AND ENORMOUS THIGHS TO SPIT INTO THE GRATE
777-126732-0006 YES I HAD THE TIME A THINK THINGS OUT A LITTLE HE ADDED WITHOUT EMPHASIS
777-126732-0007 WHEN HE ROSE PAINFULLY THE THRUSTING FOLD OF A SKINNY GROPING HAND FORMED BY GOUTY SWELLINGS SUGGESTED THE EFFORT OF A MORBID MURDERER SUMMONING ALL HIS REMAINING STRENGTH FOR A LAST STAB
777-126732-0008 HISNUNCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO A STRANGER
777-126732-0009 THE OLD TERRACE TURNED SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON A SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE
777-126732-0010 BUT I COULD NEVER GET AS MANY AS THREE SUCH MEN TOGETHER
777-126732-0011 THE POSITIONS OF PROPERTY HAD NOT ONLY TO FACE THEIR WAKEN MILITARY IT BUT THEY HAD ALSO TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES YES
777-126732-0012 STRUGGLING WARFARE WAS THE CONDITION OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP IT WAS FATAL
777-126732-0013 AH HE DID NOT DEPEND UPON EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT TO KEEP UP HIS BELIEF AND DICLAMATIONS NO ANGER NO VISIONS OF BLOOD RED FLAGS WAVING OR METAPHORICAL LORD SONS OF VENGEANCE RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON OF A DOOMED SOCIETY NOT HE
777-126732-0014 DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN THE OPTIMIZED I AM I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND IN FIFTEEN YEARS SOME MEANS TO CUT MY THROAT
777-126732-0015 A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMMON GOSSIP AND CUT THE TIREADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND HE BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXHAUSTED EYES
777-126732-0016 ALEXANDER GOSSIPIN GOT UP TOM ON HIS THREADBARE BLUE SERGE SUIT UNDER THE LOW CEILING SHOOK OFF THE STIFFNESS OF LONG INABILITY AND STROLLED THE WAY INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS TO LOOK OVER STEPHEN'S SHOULDER
777-126732-0017 VERY CHARACTERISTIC PUBLICLY TYPICAL
777-126732-0018 YOU HAD CALLED OUT LATTER GENTLEMEN WOULD YOU GRUMBLED MISTER FORLLOCK
777-126732-0019 IT WAS CALL YENT WHO WAS HEARD IMPLACABLE TO HIS LAST BREATH
777-126732-0020 LAMBRUSSA IS AN ASS
777-126732-0021 FOR HIM THE CRIMINAL IS THE PRISONER SYMBOL IS IT NOT
777-126732-0022 THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS PASTRING
777-126732-0023 THE FAMOUS TERROR HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE
777-126732-0024 THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DEADLY DRUG IN AN OLD VILE OF POISON EMPTIED NOW HE USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME
777-126732-0025 THE CALLAS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS BLUE LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASSENT
777-126732-0026 HE HAD BEEN A PRISONER HERSELF
777-126732-0027 HIS OWN SKIN HAD SIZZLED UNDER THE RED HOT GRANT HE MURMURED SOFTLY
777-126732-0028 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BECAME TO STAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT AND TIMIDED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES AND THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STAIR AS IF GUIDE IT ONLY BY THE SOUND
777-126732-0029 HE GAVE THE DISCUSSION UP WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG O THE SHOULDERS
777-126732-0030 STEEL ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM
777-126732-0031 THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND WHO REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TOURIST AS IF ROUTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN
777-126732-0032 HIS SCARED EYES BLAZED OF INDIGNATION IT WOULD HURT TOLERABLY HIS MOUTH DROPPED OPEN
777-126732-0033 COMRADE OSOPEN'S FACE TWITCHED WITH EXASPERATION
777-126732-0034 I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED MY CALL AS GENTLY
777-126732-0035 HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO WRITE UP THIS TIME
777-126732-0036 THE COALS AND THE GREAT SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND THE PALACE THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY
777-126732-0037 THE DISDAINFUL PATE OF COMMENT OSCIPEN'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE
777-126732-0038 HE PAUSED THEM ADDED WITH A MODEST FIRMNESS
777-126732-0039 I WOULD CALL IT CANBALISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS
777-126732-0040 THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREEN ON THE QUIVERING FLESH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE
777-126732-0041 STEPHEN SWALLOWED THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUTDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR
777-126732-0042 HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURN THE KEY SHOT THE BOLT
777-126732-0043 HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HER FRIENDS
777-126732-0044 WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VADICT
777-126732-0045 THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRESS EXACTED LOOMS UP MONSTROUSLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE WORRYING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE ARE THE FANATICS
777-126732-0046 AND IN ANY CASE HE HAD NOT THE TIME
777-126732-0047 NOTHING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS HE KNEW NOT MISTER LADAMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN'S PROVIDE FOR
777-126732-0048 THESE WERE BUT A FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIMES SINCE HE OPENED THIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE
777-126732-0049 YOUR SURVEY WAS UNFAVORABLE
777-126732-0050 HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEED HE WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS
777-126732-0051 HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS MOTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
777-126732-0052 MISTER VIRLOCK PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO DAVIE
777-126732-0053 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOR AND LOOKED IT TO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE
777-126732-0054 HE WATCHED HIM SPECULATING HIM MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN
777-126732-0055 STICKY PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL ON THE CAGE
777-126732-0056 THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR THAN UP IN SEVERAL PLATES FOR THE NIGHT
777-126732-0057 HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADOR AND SLEEVED CALICICAL SACK BUT TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S FACE
777-126732-0058 THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FAILS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT TO POLICE
777-126732-0059 IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE FAMILY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN
777-126732-0060 THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER RELICK BECAUSE HE HAD SATISFIED VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPPIENT FALL
777-126732-0061 THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS A WINDOW PANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD
777-126732-0062 YES NOT AT ALL WEALTH
777-126732-0063 DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UN HURRIED IN FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERNITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GASPNETH IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END IN THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING THEY CAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM
777-126732-0064 THAT POOR BOY'S IN A VERY EXCITED STATE IN THAT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LAST FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK
777-126732-0065 THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STUBE HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
777-126732-0066 THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DAZZLED THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD
777-126732-0067 MISTER VIRLOCK'S ANSIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
777-126732-0068 THAT BOYS HEARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE
777-126732-0069 IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TOIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID
777-126732-0070 HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRIFTING BLOOD WAS THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT
777-126732-0071 MISTER RELICK WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW
777-126732-0072 ASK CAR HE GROWLED SAVAGELY
777-126732-0073 HE ISN'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT SAID HERE HE BELIEVES ITS ALL TRUE
777-126732-0074 HE GOES NO BETTER HE GETS INTO HIS PASSIONS OVER IT
777-126732-0075 HE CLEARED AT ME AS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS
777-126732-0076 I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL MISSUS RLOCK BEGAN AGAIN BRISKLY
777-126732-0077 HE GIVES A RED FACE PORING OVER THEM
777-126732-0078 I WOULDN'T GIVE A HALF PETNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT
777-126732-0079 THE OTHER DAY STEPHEN GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN A SOLDIER OFFICER CARRYING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE
777-126732-0080 HE CAN'T STAND AND NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY
777-126732-0081 COMFORTABLE DARE
7850-111771-0000 THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HONABLE THOMAS EL HAMMER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
7850-111771-0001 AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TRACTICS
7850-111771-0002 GRANT ACTED AS MUSTRING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOY VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK THE FIELD
7850-111771-0003 GENERAL HALIC IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID
7850-111771-0004 INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPITON NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS
7850-111771-0005 HE WAS NOW COMPETITOR OF ALL THE FEDERAL FORCES
7850-111771-0006 THE CAPTURE OF LEAN WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING
7850-111771-0007 TIME BORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT AFTER THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER THEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING THE WAR
