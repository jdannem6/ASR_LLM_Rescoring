2277-149896-0005 MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOISTENED
2277-149896-0006 HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CARY WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
2277-149896-0007 HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL
2277-149896-0008 FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED IN NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED
2277-149896-0009 WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALIZED AND WITH HIM NO USE WAS GOOD NEWS
2277-149896-0010 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER JULIA THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
2277-149896-0011 HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RHEUMINATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
2277-149896-0012 SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GETT AWAY THIS MORNING
2277-149896-0013 HE WOULD GET ONE TODAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
2277-149896-0014 AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DRAWERLY HEADED FOR THE MEDICINE CAR
2277-149896-0015 HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CAREY
2277-149896-0016 UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FROM HIS WIFE EITHER
2277-149896-0017 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTORES FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
2277-149896-0018 HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS AND REPLY GO TO THE DEVIL
2277-149896-0019 BUT HE COMPROMISEED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY
2277-149896-0020 THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SAYING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
2277-149896-0021 WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE COMPOUNDED WRETCH
2277-149896-0022 LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION DESERTED ITSELF
2277-149896-0023 SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SET IDLE
2277-149896-0024 HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDE UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
2277-149896-0025 HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
2277-149896-0026 THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED UP COLOURS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM
2277-149896-0027 HURSTWOOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THE INSISTANCY OF THIS THING
2277-149896-0028 HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED ROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA
2277-149896-0029 HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS SAME
2277-149896-0030 HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISEED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
2277-149896-0031 HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE IT ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW
2277-149896-0032 BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT
2277-149896-0033 THEN HE RING THE BELL NO ANSWER
2277-149896-0034 HE RING AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER
2277-149897-0000 WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDRY THAN EVER
2277-149897-0001 HE COULD HARDLY REALIZE HOW IT DID ALL COME ABOUT
2277-149897-0002 NO LATTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
2277-149897-0003 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A MAN UPON THAT SCORE
2277-149897-0004 HE WAS GETTING SOME BIG COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PUNISHMENT FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
2277-149897-0005 IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT A ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP
2277-149897-0006 THEN HE FELT HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
2277-149897-0007 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GAVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
2277-149897-0008 ANY ANSWERED I GUESS NOT
2277-149897-0009 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSICINGS
2277-149897-0010 HE WAS BEATEN FOR TONIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
2277-149897-0011 SHE WOULD TAKE A ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
2277-149897-0012 IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T END IT
2277-149897-0013 FOR RELIEF HE ROSE AND JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
2277-149897-0014 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING BARON ENACTED
2277-149897-0015 IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE CORNERS THE BOY RETURNED
2277-149897-0016 HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANTIME HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
2277-149897-0017 HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR RIGHT HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE SUBJECT
2277-149897-0018 HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
2277-149897-0019 THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
2277-149897-0020 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLEAM OF DEFEAT
2277-149897-0021 HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH INN AND NOTHING DONE
2277-149897-0022 ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE ROOTED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRY AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IODHA
2277-149897-0023 IT WAS THE WORST MONDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE
2277-149897-0024 IT LOOKED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
2277-149897-0025 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGRYED AT HIS PERFIDY
2277-149897-0026 HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STIRRED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
2277-149897-0027 HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATATIONS
2277-149897-0028 HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE DID AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
2277-149897-0029 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRY BUT WHEN HE GOT IN AGGED HIM PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
2277-149897-0030 HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLACK OF THE HOUSE
2277-149897-0031 HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY
2277-149897-0032 HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT'S WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED THAT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
2277-149897-0033 ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GIRGER JAMES IN HAY IT READ
2277-149897-0034 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY
2277-149897-0035 VERY TRULY OURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE
2277-149897-0036 SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECTED
2277-149897-0037 IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUIT HIM PROMPTLY
2412-153947-0000 PREFACED TO THE SECOND EDITION
2412-153947-0001 THIS IS A MISTAKE SO A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
2412-153947-0002 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST ADVISES TO THE PRINTER
2412-153947-0003 THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISE THAT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
2412-153947-0004 I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY
2412-153947-0005 I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPACIOUS MISUSE OF ANOLOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO KNOW REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE
2412-153947-0006 BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
2412-153947-0007 I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LEIANCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
2412-153947-0008 IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RAGATO DISTRICT OF THE CANIBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRIST CHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
2412-153947-0009 I ALSO RODE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION
2412-153947-0010 I SEE FOR MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MONSIEUR'S CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING RIDERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TROOPNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
2412-153947-0011 I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAY LAY TO TWO EARLY FAVORABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALMAL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH
2412-153947-0012 THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER COST
2412-153947-0013 THE FIRST ADDITION OF IROINE SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOLDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
2412-153947-0014 I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOLT WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAD BEEN PRINTED FROM STERIOS THEN MADE
2412-153947-0015 I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF IROINE THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD
2412-153947-0016 THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPY RIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS
2412-153948-0000 IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WILL BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF
2412-153948-0001 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED TO MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
2412-153948-0002 NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WELL DOUBT MY BEING SO
2412-153948-0003 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH IMISPHERE I WAS
2412-153948-0004 SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THERE FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
2412-153948-0005 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY IN THE MANNER OF LIFE
2412-153948-0006 I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THEY WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING USE THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
2412-153948-0007 THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK YOUES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM
2412-153948-0008 IT IS THE RISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
2412-153948-0009 IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT IS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
2412-153948-0010 THE COUNTRY WAS THE GREATEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
2412-153948-0011 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GRAY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEEDING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
2412-153948-0012 EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WONDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL
2412-153948-0013 I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BARED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN
2412-153948-0014 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE CROSS IT
2412-153948-0015 I WOULD TRY THE NEAR RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
2412-153954-0000 SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED BLESSED I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
2412-153954-0001 MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR EYE THEM
2412-153954-0002 THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UN PAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN
2412-153954-0003 THE VINE GRO OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
2412-153954-0004 EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST
2412-153954-0005 EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED ISLIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT
2412-153954-0006 THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION AND FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
2412-153954-0007 EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMMONLY AND THE OLD GREAT HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN
2412-153954-0008 THE WOMEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL
2412-153954-0009 I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENDED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN A EGYPTIAN GREEK IN ITALIAN
2412-153954-0010 THE CHILDREN ARE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
2412-153954-0011 I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GODS AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
2412-153954-0012 THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEGGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
2412-153954-0013 I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TALES
2412-153954-0014 IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NOINGLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
2412-153954-0015 SUFFICED THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
2412-153954-0016 IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIMES IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
2412-153954-0017 THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
2412-153954-0018 THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELL ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
2412-153954-0019 BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN WAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
2412-153954-0020 AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF REST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS
2412-153954-0021 WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLAS IN TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES
2412-153954-0022 THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS NEARLY THE SAME
2412-153954-0023 HIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM
2412-153954-0024 HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELIEVE AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER
2428-83699-0000 I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP AT MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FEST OF SEASON
2428-83699-0001 FESIVE YES
2428-83699-0002 THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN AND A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
2428-83699-0003 IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT VE WOULD COVER
2428-83699-0004 THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE LAD
2428-83699-0005 THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
2428-83699-0006 NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PRETEILECTION FOR THE NAME MANGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
2428-83699-0007 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MATCH AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
2428-83699-0008 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MATCH AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO
2428-83699-0009 I HAD NO ALLUSIONS
2428-83699-0010 I DID NOT EXPECT THE PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT
2428-83699-0011 ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND REIGNING
2428-83699-0012 I FELL QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS
2428-83699-0013 I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MAD I MEAN MISSUS WILSON
2428-83699-0014 IT WAS A TOLERABLE JOURNEY
2428-83699-0015 HE WAS REPERVIOUS TO REASON
2428-83699-0016 IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE ESSENTIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
2428-83699-0017 WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFT IN MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATIONMASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HOOKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO
2428-83699-0018 NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGARD DEAN THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION
2428-83699-0019 THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY IN BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING
2428-83699-0020 WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPENED SPRING CART
2428-83699-0021 IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGAGE
2428-83699-0022 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
2428-83699-0023 I DID NOT ASKED I WAS BEYOND IT
2428-83699-0024 I WAS CHOKED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
2428-83699-0025 I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTUREING IN QUEST OF ONE
2428-83699-0026 HAIR WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO
2428-83699-0027 THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM
2428-83699-0028 THERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HADN'T TWISTED IT OFF
2428-83699-0029 THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WEATHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY
2428-83699-0030 NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOW A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL
2428-83699-0031 BETTER BRING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
2428-83699-0032 MAYBE THERE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROSING
2428-83699-0033 THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEM LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
2428-83699-0034 PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMING THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
2428-83699-0035 A VOICE INQUIRED WHO IS THERE
2428-83699-0036 THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
2428-83699-0037 THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AND EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
2428-83699-0038 WHO LIVED HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD
2428-83699-0039 I TOLD THE BALL AGAIN
2428-83699-0040 AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
2428-83699-0041 I MISTER CREST OF HER FROM LONDON
2428-83699-0042 WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE SELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT
2428-83705-0000 HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAVE THE LEAST
2428-83705-0001 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNOWINGS
2428-83705-0002 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARIANNES THINGS HAVE BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
2428-83705-0003 IT IS MOST DELIGHTED
2428-83705-0004 IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE IS WEDDING SO UN IMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT
2428-83705-0005 FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING
2428-83705-0006 THE INCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING
2428-83705-0007 THE GIRL IS FREDERICK BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT
2428-83705-0008 I GUESSED POSITIVELY GUESSED
2428-83705-0009 THAT'S IT UPON YOUR ACCOUNT
2428-83705-0010 FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHOSE IN THAT LINE
2428-83705-0011 I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES AND ALL SORTS OF LINES
2428-83705-0012 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROPHET OUT OF MARION'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
2428-83705-0013 IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MANNER THAT MY SUSPICION SPRINGS
2428-83705-0014 THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIG STE FOR ALL I KNOW
2428-83705-0015 WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANNE SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIG STY AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
2428-83705-0016 THERE WERE NO SOUNDS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE
2428-83705-0017 I FOUND THAT IS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
2428-83705-0018 IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED OR THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
2428-83705-0019 AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE AT HERS
2428-83705-0020 IT WAS PLAYING THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
2428-83705-0021 I SHALL MAKE PROPER GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
2428-83705-0022 A BIRD AND THE HAND IS WORTH TWO AND A BUSH AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
2428-83705-0023 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SAY IF SHE GIVES IT
2428-83705-0024 AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
2428-83705-0025 I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T YET IT
2428-83705-0026 OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE IS A WAY IN A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
2428-83705-0027 HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGUOUS
2428-83705-0028 SHE HAS A KNOCK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS
2428-83705-0029 I NOTICED THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
2428-83705-0030 THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARIAN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH THE FEELING OF RUN CHORUS A CITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
2428-83705-0031 SUCH AS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
2428-83705-0032 BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I TOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
2428-83705-0033 WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY AND PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WRITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
2428-83705-0034 THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MCPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
2428-83705-0035 AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MACPHERSON HAS MARRIED UN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
2428-83705-0036 SOME ONE SNIGGERED
2428-83705-0037 I CAN NOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SMELLINGS MOVE
2428-83705-0038 AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDINGS WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
2428-83705-0039 YES THE CARS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING

251-118436-0002 SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POYSERERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM
251-118436-0003 AS YOU WILL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOUL DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARDED NOW
251-118436-0004 A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WANE FROM HIS MOUTH
251-118436-0005 THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESK CHAMBER
251-118436-0006 THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HERE ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD
251-118436-0007 NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NECROMANCY
251-118436-0008 WITH A LONG STAINED FINGER NAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TID FLOOR

251-118436-0012 BUT AT THE URGED ENTREATY OF THE PRINCES OF CASSALA WHO LOVED BRENDA CHILD VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE
251-118436-0013 BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND CROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAT
251-118436-0014 ON THE DAYS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN WRECKED BY AWFUL PAROXYSMS

251-137823-0002 THIS ISN'T PART OF YOUR TASKING ROUTINE IS IT
251-137823-0003 ANOTHER ENGINEER RUSHED TOWARDS THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE
251-137823-0004 ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT CASTCATED FROM THE WALL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HOIST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH
251-137823-0005 AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PENNING MARK FAVOR BENEATH IT
251-137823-0006 BLOOD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
251-137823-0007 FOUR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRECKAGE
251-137823-0008 THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FOLLOWING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
251-137823-0009 TOM'S EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BELLOWING DUST
251-137823-0010 THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTING TUSES
251-137823-0011 THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PEN BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEAR BY

2803-154320-0000 FORTUNATELY WILL HALLY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESSIVE CANVAS OR HIS MASS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
2803-154320-0001 JOHN MANNGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HALL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
2803-154320-0002 THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE HIM
2803-154320-0003 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHANGED
2803-154320-0004 MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE POMPOUS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES A NEW ZEALAN FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
2803-154320-0005 HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK CARRISING

2803-154320-0013 SO THAT ON THAT SCORN THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
2803-154320-0014 BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DONCAN GOD FOR BED
2803-154328-0000 THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHIDY RANGES WERE LIT FOR THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY

2803-154328-0003 SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ADVANCE SOON LAY DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING
2803-154328-0004 IF IT IS DECREE THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TEAR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE
2803-154328-0005 GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAVE A NOBLE END IN VIEW
2803-154328-0006 GLENARBAN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED
2803-154328-0007 JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HELLONA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
2803-154328-0008 I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE
2803-154328-0009 MY LORD WHICH EVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFIL THE WISH OF LADY HELEN AND MERRY GRANT
2803-154328-0010 AT LAST THE MEASURE SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT
2803-154328-0011 THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE HAS GUARDED
2803-154328-0012 ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
2803-154328-0013 THIS SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP
2803-154328-0014 ANIMALS OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT
2803-154328-0015 WILSON AND OBANETTE JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MORATDI STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD TO A CREVICE OF THE MATTING
2803-154328-0016 WHICH COULD BE THE OBJECT
2803-154328-0017 DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS OF SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING
2803-154328-0018 THEIR FINGERS BLOOD BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASE SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
2803-154328-0019 JOHN MANGLES INSERT IN THE BLADE OF HIS POND YARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT
2803-154328-0020 BUT SOFTLY AS A NAME WAS BREATHED MERRY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GLEN ARMEN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES
2803-154328-0021 WATCH THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBBERT
2803-154328-0022 ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG COIL OF FLAX'S ROPE
2803-154328-0023 MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY ELEANOR THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU
2803-161169-0000 ONCE THERE WERE A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERYTHING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
2803-161169-0001 THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WITHZER SONGS
2803-161169-0002 WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGER COVERING
2803-161169-0003 AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE A CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE
2803-161169-0004 THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOK DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US
2803-161169-0005 WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOTPATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES
2803-161169-0006 LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
2803-161169-0007 SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR IN THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STRODE AMONG THEM
2803-161169-0008 HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHOW YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE KNOT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CAST NOT IN ITS SPUR
2803-161169-0009 FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL IN TURN INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COLD FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
2803-161169-0010 FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS A WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FEW
