2277-149896-0005 MANY LITTLE ANKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROWN MOISTENED
2277-149896-0006 HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CARRY WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
2277-149896-0007 HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED NOT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL
2277-149896-0008 FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANDED NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED
2277-149896-0009 WELL THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALIZED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS
2277-149896-0010 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DREWA THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
2277-149896-0011 HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEN DESIRED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
2277-149896-0012 SHE HAD NOT BE ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING
2277-149896-0013 HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS EGGS WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
2277-149896-0014 AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREAMERLY HEADED FOR THE MEDICINE CAR
2277-149896-0015 HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM KARA
2277-149896-0016 FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIS WIFE EITHER
2277-149896-0017 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTORX FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
2277-149896-0018 HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOURWARDS IN REPLY GO TO THE DEVIL
2277-149896-0019 BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE BOYS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY
2277-149896-0020 THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING COMPLICATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
2277-149896-0021 WHAT WOULD HE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED WRETCH
2277-149896-0022 LATER HOWEVER HIS OLDISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF
2277-149896-0023 SOMETHING HAD TO BE THEN A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE
2277-149896-0024 HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLANT SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
2277-149896-0025 HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOK OUT INTO THE STREET
2277-149896-0026 THE LONG DRISLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED UP COLLARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM
2277-149896-0027 HURSTWOOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THE INSISTNCY OF THIS THING
2277-149896-0028 HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS 'UMBRELLA
2277-149896-0029 HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS THINGS
2277-149896-0030 HE BEGAN TO WISHED THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
2277-149896-0031 HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROUND
2277-149896-0032 BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER IN OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT
2277-149896-0033 THEN HE HANG THE BELL NO ANSWER
2277-149896-0034 HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HEARTER STILL NO ANSWER
2277-149897-0000 WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANERY THAN EVER
2277-149897-0001 HE COULD HARDLYISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
2277-149897-0002 NO MATTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
2277-149897-0003 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF REASON EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
2277-149897-0004 HE WAS GETTING SOME BIG COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO CONNECTION FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
2277-149897-0005 IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED MOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP
2277-149897-0006 THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY HAVE ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
2277-149897-0007 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YESIR SAID THE BOY
2277-149897-0008 ANY ANSWER I GUESSED NOT
2277-149897-0009 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HISUSINGS
2277-149897-0010 HE WAS EATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
2277-149897-0011 SHE WOULD TAKE THE INVALIDE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
2277-149897-0012 IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK IT WOULDN'T SEND IT
2277-149897-0013 FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DREAMING
2277-149897-0014 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING VERY ENACTED
2277-149897-0015 IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE COURTS THE BOY RETURNED
2277-149897-0016 HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AS HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
2277-149897-0017 HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AND HER FAILURE TO MEET OR RIGHT HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE SUBJECT
2277-149897-0018 HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE BEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
2277-149897-0019 THREE O'CLOCK CAME POOR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
2277-149897-0020 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GROOM OF DEFEAT
2277-149897-0021 HE THOUGHT A BUSINESS SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH INN AND NOTHING DONE
2277-149897-0022 ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE ROOTED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRY AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE I OWEDA
2277-149897-0023 IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS WIFE
2277-149897-0024 IT SEEM AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
2277-149897-0025 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFITY
2277-149897-0026 HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER SCATTERED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
2277-149897-0027 HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLEXIONS
2277-149897-0028 HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STILL AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
2277-149897-0029 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRY BUT WHEN HE GOT IN AUGIUM PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
2277-149897-0030 HE DID NOT GO WITHIN THE BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
2277-149897-0031 HE TROUBLED OF HER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORALLY TO EVERYBODY
2277-149897-0032 HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT'S WATCHMENT ON HIS ROUND PULLED THAT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
2277-149897-0033 ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MAC GRIGER JAMES IN HAY IT READ
2277-149897-0034 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AN ALIMNY
2277-149897-0035 VERY TRUE YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE
2277-149897-0036 SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD UP CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
2277-149897-0037 IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SEW HIM PROMPTLY
2412-153947-0000 DEFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
2412-153947-0001 THERE IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
2412-153947-0002 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST VISES TO THE PRINTER
2412-153947-0003 THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SUPPOSED THAT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
2412-153947-0004 I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARNWINE'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY
2412-153947-0005 I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPICIOUS MISUSE OF ANOLOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE
2412-153947-0006 BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF PERCEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
2412-153947-0007 I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LEIANNCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
2412-153947-0008 IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RAGATA DISTRICT OF THE CANIBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRIST CHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
2412-153947-0009 I ALSO VOTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION
2412-153947-0010 I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MONSIEUR'S CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING RIDERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TROOPNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
2412-153947-0011 I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MADELY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALMAL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH
2412-153947-0012 THERE THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE
2412-153947-0013 THE FIRST EDITION OF IROINE SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOOLDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
2412-153947-0014 I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOLTS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAD BEEN PRINTED FROM STERIOS THEN MADE
2412-153947-0015 I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF IROY THAT WERE REPEATEDLY RE WRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD
2412-153947-0016 THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPY WRITE WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS
2412-153948-0000 IF THE READER WILL ACCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF
2412-153948-0001 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED A MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
2412-153948-0002 NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WITH DOUBT MY BEING SO
2412-153948-0003 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARED NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH I MAY FEAR I WAS
2412-153948-0004 SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR A SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
2412-153948-0005 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MATTER OF LIFE
2412-153948-0006 I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND OR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THEY WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING USED THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
2412-153948-0007 THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK HUES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM
2412-153948-0008 IT IS THE SURPRISING HOW SOON THE I BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
2412-153948-0009 IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING ONE IS WELL
2412-153948-0010 THE COUNTRY WAS THE GROUNDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
2412-153948-0011 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAND BLEEDING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
2412-153948-0012 EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LOOK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL
2412-153948-0013 I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BARED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MAYED MAN
2412-153948-0014 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE CROSSED
2412-153948-0015 I WOULD TRY THE NEAR ARRANGEMENT AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
2412-153954-0000 SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED BEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
2412-153954-0001 MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP IING ME NOR I THEM
2412-153954-0002 THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNGAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN
2412-153954-0003 THE VINE GRAND OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
2412-153954-0004 EVEN ON THIS SLEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOF AND VEGETED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST
2412-153954-0005 EACH FUTURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT
2412-153954-0006 THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS AND GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION AND FEELING THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
2412-153954-0007 EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMINGLY AND THE OLD GREAT HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN
2412-153954-0008 THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN WONDERFUL
2412-153954-0009 I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENDED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN
2412-153954-0010 THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MARY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
2412-153954-0011 I EXPRESSIONED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
2412-153954-0012 THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LUNCH BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
2412-153954-0013 I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH GROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS
2412-153954-0014 IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO ENDLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
2412-153954-0015 SUFFICEED THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
2412-153954-0016 IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN FLIGHT OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
2412-153954-0017 THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLESSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
2412-153954-0018 THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE SHEEP AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
2412-153954-0019 BUT BY AND MY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
2412-153954-0020 AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF REST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FROM IRON RAILS
2412-153954-0021 WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES
2412-153954-0022 THE DENI WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
2412-153954-0023 THIS HAD SOME FACT IN CALMING HIM
2412-153954-0024 HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELYND AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER
2428-83699-0000 I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOPP AT MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FEST OF SEASON
2428-83699-0001 FEESTIVE YES
2428-83699-0002 THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN OF A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
2428-83699-0003 IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT SEA WOULD COVER
2428-83699-0004 THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE LODGE
2428-83699-0005 THERE WAS NOTHING SET ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATIONS WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
2428-83699-0006 NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PRE ELECTION FOR THE NAME MANGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
2428-83699-0007 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MANAGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
2428-83699-0008 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MARRIAGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO
2428-83699-0009 I HAD NO REVOLUTIONS
2428-83699-0010 I DID NOT EXPECT OF PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT
2428-83699-0011 ALL DAY IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING
2428-83699-0012 I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTERATE
2428-83699-0013 I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MARRIAGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON
2428-83699-0014 IT WAS THE HORRIBLE JOURNEY
2428-83699-0015 IT WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON
2428-83699-0016 IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE AT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
2428-83699-0017 WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFT IN MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATIONMASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HAWKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO
2428-83699-0018 NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGER DEAN THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION
2428-83699-0019 THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY IN BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FERKO
2428-83699-0020 WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEARED IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CART
2428-83699-0021 IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUDGAGE
2428-83699-0022 I DID NOT KNOW HOW HE MEANT
2428-83699-0023 I DO NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT
2428-83699-0024 I WAS KILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
2428-83699-0025 I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF IT VENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE
2428-83699-0026 HOW WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO
2428-83699-0027 THERE BE A DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND HIM
2428-83699-0028 THERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HAN'T TWISTED IT OFF
2428-83699-0029 THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SEE
2428-83699-0030 NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN RECENT INTERVAL
2428-83699-0031 MATTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
2428-83699-0032 MAYBE THERE'R UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROSING
2428-83699-0033 THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SCENE LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
2428-83699-0034 PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PEARS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
2428-83699-0035 A VOICE REQUIRED WHO'S THERE
2428-83699-0036 THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCAMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
2428-83699-0037 THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE AND DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
2428-83699-0038 WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE SAD
2428-83699-0039 I TOL THE BELL AGAIN
2428-83699-0040 AFTER A VAST ACCOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
2428-83699-0041 I MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON
2428-83699-0042 WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT
2428-83705-0000 HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SEE THE LEAST
2428-83705-0001 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FROM MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SMELLINGS
2428-83705-0002 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARRY ENDS THINGS HAVE BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
2428-83705-0003 HE IS MOST DELIGHTFUL
2428-83705-0004 IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE IS WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SENT TO PLAY IN IT
2428-83705-0005 FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE MANNER OF THE RING
2428-83705-0006 THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED ON THE SUNDAY EVENING
2428-83705-0007 THE GIRL IS FRETING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT
2428-83705-0008 I GUESSED POSITIVELY GAZED
2428-83705-0009 THAT'S IT ON YOUR ENCOUNTER
2428-83705-0010 FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO WAS IN THAT LINE
2428-83705-0011 I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNOWINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES AND ALL SORTS OF LINES
2428-83705-0012 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARIANNE'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
2428-83705-0013 IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION STRINGS
2428-83705-0014 THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIG STIF FOR ALL I KNOW
2428-83705-0015 WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANNE SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIG STEY AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
2428-83705-0016 THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOAT OF LANGUAGE
2428-83705-0017 I FOUND THAT IN A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
2428-83705-0018 IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR
2428-83705-0019 AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HEARD HERS
2428-83705-0020 IT WAS PLAINLY THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
2428-83705-0021 I SHALL MAKE PAPA FORGIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
2428-83705-0022 A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO AND A BUSH AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BUY US
2428-83705-0023 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO FORGIVE AND I WILL SEE IF SHE GIVES IT
2428-83705-0024 AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO STIRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
2428-83705-0025 I HAVE DRAWN UP A LEAST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT
2428-83705-0026 OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
2428-83705-0027 HERS HAVE BEEN PRODIGIOUS
2428-83705-0028 SHE HAS A ACT OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS
2428-83705-0029 I NOTICED THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDED THEIR OFFERINGS
2428-83705-0030 THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARIAN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH THE FEELING OF RAN CHORUS A CITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
2428-83705-0031 SUCH IS THE SELFISHINESS OF HUMAN NATURE
2428-83705-0032 BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I OUGHT TOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
2428-83705-0033 WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY AND PRESENCE AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WEDDING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
2428-83705-0034 THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MICPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
2428-83705-0035 AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MACPHERSON HAS MARRY AND GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
2428-83705-0036 SOMEONE SNGGERED
2428-83705-0037 I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNOWINGS MOVE
2428-83705-0038 AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RELENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
2428-83705-0039 PI YES THE CARDS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING

251-118436-0002 SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POINTERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM
251-118436-0003 AS YOU WILL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLD DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARDED NOW
251-118436-0004 A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WEIGHIN FROM HIS MOUTH
251-118436-0005 THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE AIR BASK CHAMBER
251-118436-0006 THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HERE ROBE AND SCANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD
251-118436-0007 NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NACROMANCY
251-118436-0008 WITH A LONG STAINED FIGURE NAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TID FLOOR
251-118436-0009 THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESSAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VANDIA THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT
251-118436-0010 POINT OF CONTRADICT INQUIRED THE OTHER
251-118436-0011 ALL DISCARDED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAINED PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNEXIONS
251-118436-0012 BUT AT THE URGED ENTREATY OF THE PRINCES OF CASSALA WHO LOVED BRENDA CHILD VEINY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE
251-118436-0013 BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAD
251-118436-0014 ON THE DAIS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN WRECKED BY AWFUL PAROXYMS
251-118436-0015 THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CHORD THAT BIDS ME TO MY DYING BODY
251-118436-0016 THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALL AND THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS
251-118436-0017 THEIR FINGERS SEIZE ME LIKE FIRE
251-118436-0018 I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PILE
251-118436-0019 THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CORD OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL NIGHT WEIRD THEIR SOURCELY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH

251-136532-0002 THAT TOOK THE CENTRE OF INTEREST AWAY FROM MARKAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY
251-136532-0003 THE CIVILIAN SPECIALIST IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERES WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER CIRCUS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED
251-136532-0004 THEY HAD FOUR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMEL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRD LIKE CLAWS AND A HERB OF OAR ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH A PIG LIKE THING IN THE BIG DWARF HALL OF A MURLE AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZAEL WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
251-136532-0005 THE DAILY NEWSCASH FROM TERROR SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTEREST AT HOME

251-136532-0016 THE TARING PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
251-136532-0017 TONY LAAMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET

251-137823-0004 ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT CASTCATED FROM THE WALL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN VOICE CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH

251-137823-0006 MUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
251-137823-0007 FOR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE RICKAGE
251-137823-0008 THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FOLLY DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
251-137823-0009 TOM'S EYES VOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST
251-137823-0010 THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTINGRESSES
251-137823-0011 THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PIN BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEARBY

251-137823-0024 TOM NODDED UNHEHAPPILY
251-137823-0025 MALE OR FEMALE FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL

2803-154320-0000 FORTUNATELY WELLHALLY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESSIVE CANVAS OR HIS MASS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
2803-154320-0001 JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HALL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECT OF ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
2803-154320-0002 THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR PASS TO AMUSE THEM
2803-154320-0003 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHUNGED
2803-154320-0004 MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE POMPUS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES A NEW ZEALAN FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
2803-154320-0005 HIS EYES WANDERED CEASEOUSLY OVER THE BLIND CARRISING
2803-154320-0006 WHAT SAID MY LORD
2803-154320-0007 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY GEN

2803-154320-0012 WELL HALY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
2803-154320-0013 SO THAT ON THAT SKIRT THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
2803-154320-0014 BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FOR BED
2803-154328-0000 THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITY RANGES WERE LIT FOR THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY
2803-154328-0001 THEY HAD ONE KNIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH
2803-154328-0002 THE MULE ENDED
2803-154328-0003 SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN A ADVANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING
2803-154328-0004 IF IT IS DECREE THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LET CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE
2803-154328-0005 GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS THOSE THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW

2803-154328-0009 MY LORD WHICHEVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFIL THE WISH OF LADY HELEN AND MERRY GRANT
2803-154328-0010 AT LAST THE READER SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT
2803-154328-0011 THE JAILER MAY FORGIVE THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
2803-154328-0012 ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE A BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
2803-154328-0013 S SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP
2803-154328-0014 ANIMAL AND MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT
2803-154328-0015 WILSON AND OBANETTE JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MORATIE STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD TO A CREVICE OF THE MATTING
2803-154328-0016 WHAT SHOULD BE THE OBJECT
2803-154328-0017 DID THEY KNOW THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS OF SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING
2803-154328-0018 THEIR FINGERS BLOOD BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASING SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
2803-154328-0019 JOHN MANGLES INSERT IN THE BLADE OF HIS POND YARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELED IT
2803-154328-0020 BUT SOFTLY AS THE NAME WAS BREATHED MERRY GRAND ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GLEN ARMEN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES
2803-154328-0021 WATCHED THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBERT
2803-154328-0022 ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED THE LONG COIL A FLACK'S ROPE
2803-154328-0023 MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELEN THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILLED YOU
2803-161169-0000 ONCE THERE WAS THE FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERYTHING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
2803-161169-0001 THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WISER SONGS
2803-161169-0002 WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A RECOVERING
2803-161169-0003 AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HAD TO USE A CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STORE HOUSE
2803-161169-0004 THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR FLOATS DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US
2803-161169-0005 WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AN EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES
2803-161169-0006 LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LET THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FOLLOW UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
2803-161169-0007 SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LINE ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR IN THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STRODE AMONG THEM
2803-161169-0008 HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHOW YOU CAN SPREAD OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE KNOT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CAST NOT IN ITS SPUR
2803-161169-0009 FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURN INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
2803-161169-0010 FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS A WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL
