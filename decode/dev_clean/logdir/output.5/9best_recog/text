3752-4944-0061 LORD LOOKED DOWN UPON ME
3752-4944-0062 HE MIXED A TEASPOON OF THIS IN A PANIKIN OF WATER AND DRINK IT
3752-4944-0063 IT WE RELIEVED HIM FOR A WHILE
3752-4944-0064 IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD REACHED A CRISIS OF A DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN FOR DAYS GATHERING FORCE
3752-4944-0065 I MUST HAVE A TEA SPOONFUL HE SAID TO DELAY THE CRAVING
3752-4944-0066 JOYCE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL
3752-4944-0067 HE SMELT THE NUTTYIER ROOM OF THE SPIRIT
3752-4944-0068 THAT AT ALL TIMES DE BACING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS INFAMOUS THAT A VICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DOUBLY SINFUL IN A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN VAIN
3752-4944-0069 IN THE MIDST OF HIS ARGUMENTS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE CUPBOARD WITH THE BODY LED HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLE
3853-163249-0000 HER MEETING WITH LETTER WAS INDESCRIBABLELY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER EN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
3853-163249-0001 BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGUDGEED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
3853-163249-0002 SO CRISTY TURNED TO DEFIR TO HER PATHETIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
3853-163249-0003 NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I AM PREPARED FOR ANYTHING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVER DANCING A JAG
3853-163249-0004 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR EITHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
3853-163249-0005 I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LOVE OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
3853-163249-0006 I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HALF ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
3853-163249-0007 I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROST BITTEN OLD DAY BUT YOU FIRST KNEW AND WE'RE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE
3853-163249-0008 MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST REDDY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD
3853-163249-0009 IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD AND IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CRISTY A TOW WILL THAT SUIT

3853-163249-0011 I SHALL WAKE FOR TIME TO SHOW
3853-163249-0012 THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SYMBOL AXREAVES HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
3853-163249-0013 TO NO HOME IN THELAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
3853-163249-0014 DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARK AND HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
3853-163249-0015 IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET FURIOUS
3853-163249-0016 DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRACEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT EYE I IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
3853-163249-0017 THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
3853-163249-0018 YES DAVID SISTER'S SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOUR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
3853-163249-0019 THEN IT WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND THE GREAT HOUSE OFF MY HANDS TO SELDOM FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
3853-163249-0020 HE'S A KIND NAMELEY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY
3853-163249-0021 I KNEW YE WOULD GO I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW

3853-163249-0023 YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YO FACE DEAR I MUST GO
3853-163249-0024 NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UN SOLDIERLY CHOKING THE VOICE
3853-163249-0025 THE LOYAL FRIENDS FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
3853-163249-0026 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY NABSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS
3853-163249-0027 FINDING THAT LYCHEHA SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS
3853-163249-0028 VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILSONS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF IF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON HIS STOMACH AND SEE HOW IDLE WORK
3853-163249-0029 WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE FIDDLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERING AND SO
3853-163249-0030 HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY AND PULSES TO UP AND ADAM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IRON FULL BRANDISHING OF ALLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SOLE LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER
3853-163249-0031 TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROWS AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BAY POC AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN
3853-163249-0032 CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR ALONG SUFFERING CREATURE'S NAMES
3853-163249-0033 KNOW HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAINER ADDED ANNE LISY
3853-163249-0034 NOW SYNDIC BE YOU SATISFIED
3853-163249-0035 AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BUTNEY BREAST WEEPING COURTEOUSLY
3853-163249-0036 HIS WIFE SAID HIM WITH THE THOUGHT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED INTO APPLAUD ADVICE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3853-163249-0037 THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SWORD OF THE BURDEN SHE HAD BORN SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE
3853-163249-0038 THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTINCT WAS PRECIOUS
3853-163249-0039 THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STRLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
3853-163249-0040 NOW LET'S BE BRIEF AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT
3853-163249-0041 WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CRISTEL WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO
3853-163249-0042 AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED HERE FOR HE COULD NOT ASK AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
3853-163249-0043 NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OUR EYES WILL LAST FOR EVER
3853-163249-0044 NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTEY
3853-163249-0045 THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN HIS SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER
3853-163249-0046 SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTERS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
3853-163249-0047 DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANYTHING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOKANT TO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
3853-163249-0048 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMINDED ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE GOFFIN
3853-163249-0049 BUT I THINK FEW BRIDES DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING DOWN ANSWERED CRISTY SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WOOLEN STUFF
3853-163249-0050 MISTER PARLOR IS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY
3853-163249-0051 YOU YOUNG FOLKS MAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
3853-163249-0052 DAVID AND CRISTY WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY TREES OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
3853-163249-0053 A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIED FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORN THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFAST AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH HER SON WAS LET HIS BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVID'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
3853-163249-0054 ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STEALY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET AND A WAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND ED BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
3853-163249-0055 THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE RESENT BECAME ONE MAN TO HER
3853-163249-0056 I COULD NOT LOVE THE DEAR SO MUCH LOVE I NOT HONOUR MORE
422-122949-0000 EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE OF MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER
422-122949-0001 THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINAL ORIGINATED IN A RULING CAST PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULE OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF ALL SORTS
422-122949-0002 WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY AND ANCIENT GREENES CALLED THEMSELVES
422-122949-0003 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED
422-122949-0004 HE OFFERS WHATEVER HE RECOGNISES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION
422-122949-0005 PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION
422-122949-0006 HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESISTS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED
422-122949-0007 ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSEDES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THE DISPICABLE BEING
422-122949-0008 EVERYWHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDANCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORK GOOD AND STUPID
422-122949-0009 FOR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION AND DOORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DO NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY
422-122949-0010 IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINAL NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER PAMPLOR AND MIRATICALLY INGRINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE YOUNGER OF VANITY AS THIS OLDER PREPENSITY OWEMASTERS THE YOUNGER
422-122949-0011 THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GUIDES AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPS TO MATURITY
422-122949-0012 VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE OF THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOR THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND ATTACH HIMSELF
422-122949-0013 AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THEIR MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UPGROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND LAND CAN NO LONGER ASSION ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FOURBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING WHIRLITY
422-122949-0014 NOTHING BUT KNEW WISE NOTHING BUT NEW HOWLS NO COMMON FORMAL AS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNIC COPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A FORTENTIOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL EXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION
422-122949-0015 DANGERS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE LABOR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS
422-122949-0016 WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHYS WHO APPEAR AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH
422-122949-0017 THIS IS THE TROUBLE OF RACE
422-122949-0018 IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBIANISM AND BODY AND SOUL
422-122949-0019 THE NOBLE SOUL EXCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS CONSTRAINED OR ARBITRARYNESS THEREIN BUT RATHER WAS SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF
422-122949-0020 ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGEROUS REQUIREMENT TOIL THEIR ORIGINATES THERE FROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION
422-122949-0021 THE GREATER THE DANGER THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN DANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH ANY INTERCOURSE
422-122949-0022 ALSO WHEN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHEN THE DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES HAS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTOUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER
422-122949-0023 WHICHEVER GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN A SOUL AWAKENS MOST READILY BEGIN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THESE DECIDE AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS
422-122949-0024 A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAYS SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREON IT SEES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINSIC NEEDS
422-122949-0025 PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE IT SEPARATES ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISGUISES EPICUREISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS ITSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND
422-122949-0026 THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO WAS AFFECTED WITH IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SAINT FOR IT IS JUST HOLINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION
422-122949-0027 OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE THE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION IN THEIR BEST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HIS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS ARE NOW TOO HEAVY
422-122949-0028 AND WHOEVER THOU ART WHAT IS IT THAT DOWN PLEASES THEE
422-122949-0029 ONLY NAME IT WHATEVER I HAVE I ALTER THEE
422-122949-0030 BUT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM WHEN YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT IT
422-122949-0031 THERE MUST BE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVED ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME ENIGMA THEREIN
422-122949-0032 PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING FOR MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BE BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IT IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
422-122949-0033 I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARD PEACE HAVE FLOWN OVER MY TABLE
422-122949-0034 TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE RISE OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO
422-122949-0035 AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROLLGISH AND CHEERFUL VICE POLITENESS
5338-24615-0000 IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLEY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR BROTHER HAMLET OF TO LE VAILLON CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETOR
5338-24615-0001 THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN HIGH ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF THE ENGLISH COTTAGES
5338-24615-0002 OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSUMMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDDAM WITH HER CLOSE CAP DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSHED LIKE A SIBYL AND FRENZY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE CELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNBURNT LOITERERS SALUTED HIM WITH A SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM WITH TO HIS DOWNCOURGEON THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VIRLETS SCREAMING ALL THE WOUND FROM THE VERY TOP OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLLY TROUBLE TO THE ENDOWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRAND
5338-24615-0003 THE EVIL AND REMEDY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENISE DOG BILL
5338-24615-0004 YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES IN FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MONERVA
5338-24615-0005 THIS AVENUE WAS STRAIGHT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROW A VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESTNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SICK OFHERS WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHTS AND NOURISHED SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOUGHS COMPLETELY OVERARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BENEATH
5338-24615-0006 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOUGHS OF THE SHADY ARKE THAT VAULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY
5338-24615-0007 THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NARROW AND STEEP BRIEF BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE
5338-24615-0008 IT HAD BEEN BUILT IN A PERIOD WHEN CASTLES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESIGNING A DOMESTIC RESIDENCE
5338-24615-0009 NEITHER DID THE FROM INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER
5338-24615-0010 STABLES AND OTHER OFFICERSS OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE
5338-24615-0011 TWO ELEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE ENCLOSURE
5338-24615-0012 THIS WORK OF ARTHUR WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND
5338-24615-0013 THE COURT WAS FATIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITTER
5338-24615-0014 EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SCENE STILL MAINTAINED THE MONASTIC ILLUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAVERLEY HAD CONQUERED UP
5338-24640-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFADANT
5338-24640-0001 MISTER MORLAND REPLIED THE FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT
5338-24640-0002 EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER WHARTON WERE WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE PAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE
5338-24640-0003 MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAY RELEASED VISIT TO DAWNALD BEING LEAN
5338-24640-0004 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HAIR BRAINED EXPLANATION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME
5338-24640-0005 HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE ROADS FEAR IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
5338-24640-0006 MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAY LOUISE REVIEW WITH DAWN OLD BEING LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
5338-24640-0007 HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INTERFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE WRECKS OF THE INQUISITION
5338-24640-0008 THEY HELD CONTENTABLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TO ARMS DURING THOSE RAINS
5338-24640-0009 SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH THE BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT
5338-284437-0000 IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAYING IN APPEARANCE
5338-284437-0001 HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TRIMLEY WHO IS OUR QUEEN
5338-284437-0002 WHAT THE LITTLE CABIN
5338-284437-0003 EXCLAIMED TRORIT OF COURSE
5338-284437-0004 DID YOU SUPPOSE A PAUSE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
5338-284437-0005 THESE ANTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD
5338-284437-0006 THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT QUEER THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
5338-284437-0007 THE PEOPLE MUST WIN OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE
5338-284437-0008 SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAW A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARTING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
5338-284437-0009 SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINK KEYS BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
5338-284437-0010 HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROCK SKIN
5338-284437-0011 WHAT IS IT CORNILY SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
5338-284437-0012 THE TWIN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST
5338-284437-0013 SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE OF BUTTON BRIGHT OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAPTAIN WILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
5338-284437-0014 WERE YOU A GIANT
5338-284437-0015 PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RID O KILL ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY
5338-284437-0016 THERE IS NOTHING GROTESQUE ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
5338-284437-0017 CORPORAL DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN
5338-284437-0018 EVEN IN AMERICA EVERYBODY BOWS LOWED OUR PRESIDENT AND THE BLUE SKINS ARE SO FRIGHTENED OF THEIR BOWELROE THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM
5338-284437-0019 BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TORNOLLING GRAVELY
5338-284437-0020 THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY REGARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS
5338-284437-0021 IN THAT CASE SAID BUTINBRIGHT YOUR ENTITLE TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
5338-284437-0022 IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINK THESE WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
5338-284437-0023 NO ALL OUR WAY IS BEST
5338-284437-0024 THE QUEEN IS NOTHING WITH THEIR POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADDRESS GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER
5338-284437-0025 THEY HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE
5338-284437-0026 AFTER MY DEATH THE PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRANDCOURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKYS AND AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOUR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
5338-284437-0027 A FORTUNATE BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE
5338-284437-0028 IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FRUIT
5338-284437-0029 YES IT WAS WELLT AND STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AND WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
5338-284437-0030 YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKEIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
5338-284437-0031 IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOURE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND
5338-284437-0032 WE DO NOT HAT YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUE SKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HEAR AND I REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
5338-284437-0033 I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT LOOK FIRST
5536-43358-0000 THE SAVAGE PHILOSOPHER THE DUE OLD MIND
5536-43358-0001 THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT VICTORY THAT SURROUNDS AND EMBRACES US WAS AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS EXALTED
5536-43358-0002 IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ATTEND TO GOD IN WORDLESS ADORATION
5536-43358-0003 NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR CONFESS OR IN ANY WAY MEDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER
5536-43358-0004 AMONG US SOME MEN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY
5536-43358-0005 THAT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED IN THE WORD BAM DAY LITERALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY TRANSLATED FASTING AND DREAMING
5536-43358-0006 THE FIRST BOMBA DAY OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARTON EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CONFIRMATION OR CONVERSION IN THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE
5536-43358-0007 KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS OR SACRIFICES OTHER THAN SIMILAR OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO
5536-43358-0008 AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNROWS OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVERLOOKING THE GLORY OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF HIS ARMY FOR A NIGHT AND THE DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER
5536-43358-0009 WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THE VAPA BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS
5536-43358-0010 IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IN PROVIDENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TALENTS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION
5536-43358-0011 TO THE ONTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PROLIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL
5536-43358-0012 IN THIS TIME OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF FAVOR OR HELP
5536-43358-0013 FROM THE SON AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRESS BALL IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER TO EARTH OUR HIDDEN EMBRIOS OF PLANTS AND MEN
5536-43358-0014 THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL PAIR
5536-43358-0015 NOTHING OF THE MARVELLOUS COULD ASTONISH HIM AS THAT A BEASTS SHOULD SPEAK OR THE SUN STANDS STILL
5536-43358-0016 WHO THEY CONDEMN HIS SUPERSTITION
5536-43358-0017 HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OUR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH ALL THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION
5536-43358-0018 IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPPING VALIANTS OF THE RICH NEIGHBOR
5536-43358-0019 THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE AMID THAT THE INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS OATH
5536-43359-0000 HE HAD EITHER A NATIONAL ARMY NOR AN ORGANIZED CHURCH
5536-43359-0001 HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO UNSTILL INTO THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THE SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION
5536-43359-0002 THE ORDEAL AS BEST MET ALONE WHERE NO CURIOUS OR PITYING EYES EMBARRASS HER WHERE ALL NATURE SAYS TO HER SPIRIT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THE FULFILLING OF LIFE
5536-43359-0003 THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER IN THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE BUT SHE HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BEE'S SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS
5536-43359-0004 IN DUE TIME THE CHILD TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVERENTLY OF HIS POWERS
5536-43359-0005 INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENCE AS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THE YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
5536-43359-0006 THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNITE BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT
5536-43359-0007 THE REMOTER DEGREES OF KINGSHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNIZED AND THAT NOT AS A MATTER OF FORMALY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM AND A RIGID MORALITY FORBADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS AND ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CLAN
5536-43359-0008 WHEN SHE FELT THE WHOLE RACE FELL WITH HER
5536-43359-0009 BEFORE THIS CALAMITY CAME UPON US YOU COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE HAPPIER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INDIAN WOMAN
5536-43359-0010 HIS DAILY DEVOTTIONS WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD
5536-43359-0011 WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON A SCENE THAT IS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDERCLODE WITH THE RAINBOWS GOING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN A WHITE WATERFALL IN THE HEART OF THE GREEN GORGE A VAST PRAIRIE TINGE WITH THE BLOOD RED OF SUNSET HE PAUSS FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP
5536-43359-0012 WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LIVES TO MAKE A NOTABLE EFFORT TO PROVE HIS GRATITUDE
5536-43359-0013 HE CUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSHEL OF THE MEAT AND CAST IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST ETH THE REAL ELEMENT
5536-43359-0014 THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWAM IS ONLY LIMITED BY THE INSTITUTION A WAR
5536-43359-0015 OUR HONOR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR IS SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP
5536-43359-0016 LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MAINING INSTINCT AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING
5536-43359-0017 BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY IN ALL TRIALS AS THE MARK OF A MAN
5536-43359-0018 THIS BOND IS BETWEEN MEN AND MAN IS USUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH
5536-43363-0000 REINCARNATION AND THE CONVERSEAL SPIRITS
5536-43363-0001 THEREFORE HE QUARTERED DEATH AND BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
5536-43363-0002 THE MEN BLACKEN THEIR FACES AND WIDOWS ARE BERETHED PARENTS SOMETIMES DASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS TILL THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD
5536-43363-0003 GIVING THEMSELVES UP POLLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED ABOUT A NEAT EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE FIRST COMERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS IN THEIR HOME
5536-43363-0004 IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROBES AND FINALLY IN A SECURE COVERING OF ROCK HIDE
5536-43363-0005 AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OR A WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW T P B WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT BESIDE IT NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSED THE SPIRIT COULD USE THE IMPLEMENTS OR EAT THE FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE
5536-43363-0006 IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OF ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS PACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE AND BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH
5536-43363-0007 AT EVERY MEALTIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX IN AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD
5536-43363-0008 AT THE END OF A YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE RELATIVES MADE A PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTURRED WITH APPROPRIATE CEREMONIOUS
5536-43363-0009 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED A COLD POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL TESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND ANOTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE
5536-43363-0010 NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAD BEEN COLOURED TO SUIT TO NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROPHETS BAKERS AND CONJURS HAD BECOME THE PAST OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD
5536-43363-0011 THIS WAS CARRIED ABOUT TO THE LETTER
5536-43363-0012 THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHIZES
5536-43363-0013 ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RUN RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD
5536-43363-0014 AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BANNER FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
5536-43363-0015 FIVE DAYS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM AWFUL SLAUGHTER
5536-43363-0016 THERE ARE MANY TRUSTWORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THESE OF SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS FORETOLD
5536-43363-0017 AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FOUR ALICE ON THE ASCINNA BONE RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR A NIGHT CAMP
5536-43363-0018 MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INFORMATION
5536-43363-0019 THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SUWARD PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MAN OF HIS BAND
5694-64025-0000 CHILO
5694-64025-0001 THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE AT WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
5694-64025-0002 I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WINDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNON CAPTURED ET CETERA
5694-64025-0003 ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHIMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED GLADDENS
5694-64025-0004 AS GLAD RODE BY US A COURIER WROTE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
5694-64025-0005 ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCED AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
5694-64025-0006 WE WERE SUPPORTING AND ALABAUM WERE GAY
5694-64025-0007 THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSE GIVE HIM HAIL COLUMBIA
5694-64025-0008 THE FACT IS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS
5694-64025-0009 WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FLYING ALL DAY
5694-64025-0010 I HAD HEARD AND RED OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLE FIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF TOWN AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLE TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
5694-64025-0011 I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THEY ORDERED TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
5694-64025-0012 OFFICERS COULD NOT CURURB THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE
5694-64025-0013 ON MONDAY THAT TIDE WAS REVERSED
5694-64025-0014 BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN ATHOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS IN EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
5694-64025-0015 SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO THE HISTORY
5694-64025-0016 ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTIONS STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES
5694-64025-0017 I'M MONDAY MORNING I TOO CAPTURED BY MULE
5694-64025-0018 IT WAS WISE AND ITS OWN CONCEIT
5694-64025-0019 I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS NEW
5694-64025-0020 MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND NO TWISTER ON HIS NOSE
5694-64025-0021 SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CAISSON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP
5694-64025-0022 THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULES KNOW AND HE WAS HIGHLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK
5694-64025-0023 ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A NEEDLE TOO SMALL
5694-64029-0000 WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON THEY WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
5694-64029-0001 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASH FELL THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
5694-64029-0002 OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MARFRISBOROUGH
5694-64029-0003 FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO POCKET DUTY
