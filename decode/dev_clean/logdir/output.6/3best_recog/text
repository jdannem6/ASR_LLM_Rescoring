5694-64029-0004 THE ANKLE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
5694-64029-0005 I AM A BED YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SOCIETY ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF FROM THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET
5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABED AT MY GUN
5694-64029-0010 HE DEFID MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINES AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE WEREJOINED OUR REGIMENT
5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONES RIVER ON THE YANKI SIDE
5694-64029-0014 BAD GENERAL SHIP BY THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
5694-64029-0015 THE PROPHET COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
5694-64029-0016 I CALL LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME AND OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK
5694-64029-0017 THE YAKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDERED FORWARDS TO THE ATTACK
5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WORKERS AND TURN PIPE
5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SEES FIRE AND YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MAN CEASE FIRING YOU WERE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
5694-64029-0021 OAKLY COLORED BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE AKY LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED
5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEAT EM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT TO HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
5694-64029-0025 I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOKE ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SIGHED GREAT GOD
5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROWN
5694-64029-0029 BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MAN'S SHOES
5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED AT FOOT QUICK
5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEESS APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETS SAID RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK
5694-64038-0000 ADVANCE INTO TENNESSI
5694-64038-0001 JACK SAYS WHAT ARE YOU DO IN JOHNNIE
5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED AROUND AT LANA CROSSED THE CHANOWCHI AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSON
5694-64038-0003 OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEEM NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YONK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAY BE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HALLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS
5694-64038-0006 A YAK HE ALL WAS SAYS NAGGER
5694-64038-0007 THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENLY
5694-64038-0008 A MAN ON THE WELL
5694-64038-0009 THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEARD
5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON SETDER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSALED PROBLEM
5694-64038-0012 THE POOR FELLOW STATEED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL AROUND IN THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
5694-64038-0014 I DON'T THINK A GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
5694-64038-0015 WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSE SIDE OF TENNESSE RIVER
5694-64038-0016 WE HAD BEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART COULD THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVE THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
5694-64038-0018 WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE AND EVERY SKIRMISH AND EVERY ADVANCE AND EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY AND EVERY DEFEAT
5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BY AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES THERE WAS NO GO
5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER A WHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN I GANNY THE LAW
5694-64038-0021 YE SEE JIM NOED THE LAW
5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT GIMBLET TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LOW THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURPHY BARREL PIKE
5694-64038-0024 A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JUNE'S REGIMENT
5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT THAT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
5895-34615-0000 BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYANIM OF JOY
5895-34615-0001 SUCH PERFECT COMPLETEINESS IS NOT IN NATURE
5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMITATION WHY NOT
5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULLAORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMITATION
5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS AT MOUNTEBANK
5895-34615-0006 HE SHOWED HIMSELF UPON THE PLATFORM
5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LACK HIMSELF
5895-34615-0008 THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND UPON THE INTERIOR
5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICKTUS
5895-34615-0010 ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRIVATED IT
5895-34615-0011 IN EVERLASTING LAUGH
5895-34615-0012 THE MANICHEIANS BELIEVE THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
5895-34615-0013 THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODRIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT
5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVER LASTING
5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAGE THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENCE TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANCEASIA
5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GEMNESS AND AN ATHLETE
5895-34615-0018 CONTEMPLAT HAD YELLOW HAIR
5895-34615-0019 HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DIED WITH SOME CARROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANIN THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION HOWEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE COLD IN STORIES
5895-34622-0001 IN GWYNPLAINE'S EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE KNOW REMORSE
5895-34622-0002 WHAT WAS THIS SOMETHING
5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FORTY A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
5895-34622-0004 THE WHEATS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIRGROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TWO PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE ROSE
5895-34622-0007 THE ESTABLISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATOR
5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED TASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT
5895-34622-0010 THE AFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING
5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSSFARD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FATES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASS ON TO ANOTHER
5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATION OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SHOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE RED PHEBE AND VENUS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
5895-34622-0015 PHOBE COOKED VENUS SCRUBBED THE TEMPLE
5895-34622-0016 URSIUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BED CHAMBER AND ADDRESSING ROOM TO URSUS IN GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DEVOTED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITION FROM EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0019 A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
5895-34622-0020 URSIUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
5895-34622-0021 THEN I LOOKS PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITENDERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
5895-34622-0023 URSUS WASN'T EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWARD
5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHTFUL TO URSUS
5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL IS A SANE ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED HAVING ONLY BY THE ARTIST'S DOOR
5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOOKS
5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THE THEATRE READY MADE
5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DROP INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
5895-34629-0007 THE BLACKARD GWYNPLAINEED THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES PHEBE AND SOMETIMES VENUS
5895-34629-0009 WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE JUTRY
5895-34629-0010 THEY BEGAN THEIR PROVINCES
5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MAN TOBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTH WORK RENT IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MEN
5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TOTTING ZO FIELD WERE A GASTIC GWYNPLAINE
5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE OUT THEIR PUBLIC
5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWARDS AND THE GRIMACERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS CANADIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PREDIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAGSPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
5895-34629-0019 THE STORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
5895-34629-0020 THESE WERE REMARKABLE TYRANTS
5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDANT SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARD BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC GARDENS
5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTYING OF TAKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOISSEER WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MEN
5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSES TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
5895-34629-0029 THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNCERTAIN VISITOR
5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SAYING MASTER NICHOLAS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
5895-34629-0031 WOULD A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMISH SCOUNDREL
5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME WHEELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
6241-61943-0000 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP FALKERY
6241-61943-0001 BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFERING
6241-61943-0002 WELL AND HAVE WE A FAR WIND
6241-61943-0003 MY ALK WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET
6241-61943-0004 BUT NO GHOST FOR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
6241-61943-0005 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE WAS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HERO AT PRINCE OF DENMARK
6241-61943-0006 NO MISTER HARD WIGS SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
6241-61943-0007 AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAYS
6241-61943-0008 ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNTAIN MAJOR'S YOKELE WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
6241-61943-0009 THE VOLGORY KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD
6241-61943-0010 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WAILS AND SHARKS
6241-61943-0011 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE THIS LAND
6241-61943-0012 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PURITANICAL VESSEL
6241-61943-0013 THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THAT SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
6241-61943-0014 HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BEARIN TRAMP
6241-61943-0015 THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHO HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
6241-61943-0016 THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ISLANDIC AND LATIN
6241-61943-0017 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESS HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6241-61943-0018 NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AUNT GOES WELL THE WORST DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
6241-61943-0019 IN THE MEANTIME THERE HAS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
6241-61943-0020 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SAK NUISOME
6241-61943-0021 I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSOLE THEM
6241-61943-0022 THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENCE ON DUTY
6241-61943-0023 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE KILLED FOR CENTURIES
6241-61943-0024 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR INCONGREGATION
6241-61943-0025 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
6241-61943-0026 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRIVING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
6241-61943-0027 THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MEAN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LATTER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESKIMOES BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POOR CIRCLE
6241-61946-0000 I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARTING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
6241-61946-0001 HAWNS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP
6241-61946-0002 OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WIP OR SPUR
6241-61946-0003 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FORE PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTH WEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VANACULAR IS CALLED SUEDVEST FURDINGER
6241-61946-0004 WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARCE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
6241-61946-0005 THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEEDED AT A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
6241-61946-0006 I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED SENTAR
6241-61946-0007 SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
6241-61946-0008 WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY DIED
6241-61946-0009 I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SACRIFICE
6241-61946-0010 MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEG ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
6241-61946-0011 HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN IN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BIRD OR ISLAND A HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS IN THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
6241-61946-0012 A FEW STRAIGHT HALLS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
6241-61946-0013 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNUFFLES WHERE A GLUMMORATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
6241-61946-0014 IT CONSISTS SIMPLY A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
6241-61946-0015 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDENER WAS TO BE FOUND
6241-61946-0016 THESE SECRET EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
6241-61946-0017 TO RIDE OUR SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
6241-61946-0018 IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENT THAN THEIRS
6241-61946-0019 BUT MY UNCLE WAS N'T NO HUMOUR TO WAIT
6241-61946-0020 AT LENGTH THE STARTY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSS OF ROADS
6241-61946-0021 HE SAYS TIED REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DAINTISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
6241-61946-0022 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FIELD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
6241-61946-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FAIRY BOATS OF THE ALB I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
6241-66616-0000 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRE SIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
6241-66616-0001 ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON A BIG ONE'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
6241-66616-0002 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MEAN PURPOSE FAILED
6241-66616-0003 A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON HUNGER AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
6241-66616-0004 THREE DAYS LATER MINIATALKI BECAME NOISON'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
6241-66616-0005 FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEED WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNDER THE SECOND GENERATION
6241-66616-0006 MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEW SUM AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
6241-66616-0007 THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND KNEW SOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MIN A TALKING
6241-66616-0008 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABBY RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETOCKI AS SHE BECAME OVER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
6241-66616-0009 WHILE BEYOND THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWORE THE SINEWY AND AGILE AS A LINKS AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
6241-66616-0010 ONE OF NEW SOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINUTE TALKING AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
6241-66616-0011 CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PAST AND POOR ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
6241-66616-0012 THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRAVE PUPILS AND BY THE TIME ROBY WAS SIXTEEN AND MANY A TALKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
6241-66616-0013 IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOUNDEDS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
6241-66616-0014 AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A TRACE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
6241-66616-0015 BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETALKI AND HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0016 NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GROOM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
6241-66616-0017 A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND A MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
6241-66616-0018 BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WHILE HE WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNA TALKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0019 THEY WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNEDING TO HIS PEOPLE
6241-66616-0020 SPRING CAME IN PAST AND IN SUMMER
6241-66616-0021 WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN INTO TROTE IN THREE YEARS
6241-66616-0022 WE WILL HUNT BULLS THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN
6241-66616-0023 THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WHILE THEY GO ON'S REPLY
6241-66616-0024 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET RIGHT AT SPRUCE WOOD ON THE BLACKSTONE RIVER
6241-66616-0025 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF ROBB'S LETTER FOUND RAWDON HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
6295-244435-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE WHOM COMING
6295-244435-0001 COLONELLY AND IDEST HELBUT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
6295-244435-0002 BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRI AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE A VICTORY ONLY
6295-244435-0003 BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORT END THE SHORE
6295-244435-0004 THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER THE HARBOUR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS EDGE SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
6295-244435-0005 THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMMER IS OURS
6295-244435-0006 THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED
6295-244435-0007 ALL THE IMMINITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
6295-244435-0008 THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSE AND ARKENSA FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KUTUKI AND MAZURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
6295-244435-0009 LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERY WHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURE
6295-244435-0010 THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIDS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY
6295-244435-0011 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLEAM
6295-244435-0012 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOURITE THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
6295-244435-0013 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYONE WITH IT
6295-244435-0014 BORGYARD AT ONCE RODE IN ORDER
6295-244435-0015 COLONEL KENTIN WRITES WISELY
6295-244435-0016 WE NEED KUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
6295-244435-0017 HENRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DE LINA'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE
6295-244435-0018 HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BY
6295-244435-0019 HARRI GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
6295-244435-0020 WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS BRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
6295-244435-0021 IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LATER IN APRIL
6295-244435-0022 FOR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED IN GRAVE
6295-244435-0023 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHOW OF THEM
6295-244435-0024 HE GAZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PEARLS
6295-244435-0025 BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VILT ON THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
6295-244435-0026 IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND FROLAGE
6295-244435-0027 HE WAS GO HOME AFTER VICTORY
6295-244435-0028 HE SOON LEFT CHARLES BEEN OUT OF SIGHT
6295-244435-0029 HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATES
6295-244435-0030 PEOPLE WERE CRUELR HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
6295-244435-0031 THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SELF CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANGLE TO IT
6295-244435-0032 IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CRESCENTS
6295-244435-0033 IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WASHINGTON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIGH STRENGTH AND AGILITY
6295-244435-0034 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES AN OLD KANTUCKY
6295-244435-0035 BILL SKILL AND IS GANG THEN MOUNTAINEERS WERE UP
6295-244435-0036 HE DID NOT SEE THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERY MAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
6295-244435-0037 IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLONIS
6295-244435-0038 HARRY THANKED HIM THROUGH HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVING MEN RODE AWAY
6295-244435-0039 THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT PARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
6295-244435-0040 BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TINKLED
6295-64301-0000 ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR CHEST BRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
6295-64301-0001 IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY IN SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY
6295-64301-0002 WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTCATH
6295-64301-0003 HE PRESSED HIS VIOL IN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
6295-64301-0004 EARTH WAS GOD AND HEAVEN WAS ALL
6295-64301-0005 BLESS HIM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESS SHALL I BE THERE THEN
6295-64301-0006 WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOLMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLORS
6295-64301-0007 JUST THEN HE WAS AT NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS
6295-64301-0008 THE NETTLE AND THE DARK SAID JOSEPH
6295-64301-0009 HE WAS IN THE MOOD FROM MUSIC WAS HE NOT
6295-64301-0010 HE LAY DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE
6295-64301-0011 LYDIE FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR
6295-64301-0012 THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DULL INSTRUMENTS
6295-64301-0013 BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND OF VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC
6295-64301-0014 THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTEN IN SILENCE
6295-64301-0015 HER HEART SEEMED TO SMELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING
6295-64301-0016 A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS SHOWED FREELY
6295-64301-0017 LETTER TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC
6295-64301-0018 LET BUT A MOVE BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD
6295-64301-0019 IT CRIED ALOUD THE ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM
6295-64301-0020 NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICION
6295-64301-0021 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT NEW NOT ITSELF
6295-64301-0022 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD
6295-64301-0023 WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIOUS EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE

6295-64301-0025 A SOB LIKE A BIRD KNEW BORN BURST FROM MERRY'S BOSOM
6295-64301-0026 THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM ASSERTING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
6295-64301-0027 HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUSNESS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
6295-64301-0028 HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THAT THEN SOME MOUSE STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
6295-64301-0029 IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TERRORING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
6295-64301-0030 HIS VIOLENT WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE HOLE
6295-64301-0031 HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HISSELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD
