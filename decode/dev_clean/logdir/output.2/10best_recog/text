1988-147956-0006 DON'T GET PICKED UP COMFORTABLE AFTER A WHILE MISSUS MERRICK MAKE GOOD HOUSE
1988-147956-0007 MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOW TONE TO FOREIGNERS AS IF THEY WERE DEAF
1988-147956-0008 SHE MADE MISSUS MERRICK TO UNDERSTAND THE FRIENDLY INTENTION OF OUR VISIT AND THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN HANDLED THE LOAVES OF BREAD AND EVEN SMELLED THEM AND EXAMINED THE PYES WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY EXCLAIMING MUCH GOOD MUCH THINK
1988-147956-0009 THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORN CAKES AND SORGAM MALESSES FOR THREE DAYS
1988-147956-0010 I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT OUR EYES
1988-147956-0011 HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK CURL
1988-147956-0012 EVEN FROM THE DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
1988-147956-0013 HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS WERE A SMART
1988-147956-0014 AMBUSH HE MAY GOOD FARMER
1988-147956-0015 HE STRUCK AMBROWSH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY
1988-147956-0016 AT THAT MOMENT THE BOTH CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK
1988-147956-0017 IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT PUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT I REMEMBER IN VIRGINIA
1988-147956-0018 I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAMED HIS OWN HANDS WERE
1988-147956-0019 WE STILL PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US
1988-147956-0020 THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRL SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM
1988-147956-0021 SHE LOOKED AT HIM HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY
1988-147956-0022 SHE POINTED INTO THE COLD COTTONWOOD TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME
1988-147956-0023 ANTONIA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTION TO ME WITH HER GLANCE
1988-147956-0024 SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND HUNG HER HANDS
1988-147956-0025 SHE WAS QUICK AND SO EAGER
1988-147956-0026 WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GROUND THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US
1988-147956-0027 AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASED SILVER RING WHAT SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER
1988-147956-0028 WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR TWELVE SECONDS
1988-147956-0029 I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USE TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY ELDERS
1988-148538-0000 IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTURES AND BOISTEROUS GAYETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACYIES ARE NOT FOMP OF BEING THUS FILNCY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELF WITHOUT REGRET
1988-148538-0001 AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESULT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUED TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHOOTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
1988-148538-0002 I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PORTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
1988-148538-0003 THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE THREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES
1988-148538-0004 THEN THERE ARE IN OLD CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSULTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIES AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE FORTUNE
1988-148538-0005 I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATEO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OFF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACY WERE COMPOSIVE A VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LETTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
1988-148538-0006 IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN IS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH THE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST THEM ACCREVIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
1988-148538-0007 CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTUREES THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
1988-148538-0008 THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT THE SMALLEST CENJURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE
1988-148538-0009 IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AY HERE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
1988-148538-0010 IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS AND JOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTH YOU TO ENJOY IT
1988-148538-0011 IN ARIS TO CREDIT COUNTRIES THE GREATS POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACQUIES THEM
1988-148538-0012 THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF FLAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERYONE PERCEIVES AT NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
1988-148538-0013 THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASHAMED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
1988-148538-0014 WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HOLY FOAM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CAUSES OF THE NATION
1988-148538-0015 THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PUR ALL JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRACYIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE EQUALLY CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE A SCENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION
1988-24833-0000 THE TWO STRAYED KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
1988-24833-0001 SOMEHOW OR OTHER CAP HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE IS IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR FUND NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING
1988-24833-0002 SHE DOESN'T PICKED THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SHE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASMMA
1988-24833-0003 WHEN ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING THE START ON ANNEXICATES CAT HOME
1988-24833-0004 RIGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME ON NEW PROGRAM HE SAYS HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THIS HALF

1988-24833-0014 POP GOES RIGHT ON TAKING HIS CHANNEL
1988-24833-0015 YOU GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
1988-24833-0016 IT'S YOUR FALL MARBLE UP YOURSELF
1988-24833-0017 I HEAR THE TEA BE GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MORROW
1988-24833-0018 WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A EYES TEBDY PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
1988-24833-0019 I LOOK AT MY WATCH THERE'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
1988-24833-0020 I TURN OFF THE TELEGE AND SAID I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S A SPOOK AFTER ALL
1988-24833-0021 IT'S THE FIRST TIME HELDDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND
1988-24833-0022 I TOLD TIME WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAID SILDA

1988-24833-0025 YOU KNOW I'D GET DRUFT IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
1988-24833-0026 I'VE DECIDED TO AM LIST IN THE ARMY
1988-24833-0027 I'LL HAVE TO TRICK SOME MORE SAYS TOM
1988-24833-0028 HERE ARE TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
1993-147149-0000 HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARDENTERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH
1993-147149-0001 WHAT BANKRIPS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEIZES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS
1993-147149-0002 THE SCHOOL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BAKED OF ITS PREY
1993-147149-0003 THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOUT CLIPPLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PERISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT
1993-147149-0004 MARGARET MET JIM WILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
1993-147149-0005 SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSONS DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
1993-147149-0006 SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAWS BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN BUT SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SURFACE A TEA IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
1993-147149-0007 OVER THE CHILD WHICH HAD BREATHED THE FATHER BEN WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
1993-147149-0008 IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THAN YOU
1993-147149-0009 BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH AND HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UPSTAIRS AS IF AFRAID AWAKENING HIM
1993-147149-0010 WISHING HIM SAID FANNY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY
1993-147149-0011 THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE IN WEPT
1993-147149-0012 HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO DRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
1993-147149-0013 MARIAN ALICE DREW HEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
1993-147149-0014 THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAY
1993-147149-0015 BEFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FOLK COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD NOW YOU HAVE HEARD HOW I HAVE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
1993-147149-0016 BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDRY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
1993-147149-0017 O JOHN DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
1993-147149-0018 HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HANDS TOUCHED SHRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
1993-147149-0019 DON'T JIM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVEDING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF
1993-147149-0020 MARRY I ALMOST CLOTHED MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PASSED AND GONE AND MARRY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
1993-147149-0021 HE REMAINED UPSTAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MERRY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED IN QUIET STREETS TO TRYING GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
1993-147149-0022 SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JIM AND DECITING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
1993-147149-0023 HER THOUGHTS RANG ON JIM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
1993-147149-0024 I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE HIS DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WITH HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
1993-147149-0025 I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I RATHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWNRIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
1993-147149-0026 BUT WILL HE THANK BEYOND IT
1993-147149-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWARDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISSUS SIMON'S YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
1993-147149-0028 THE OLD LEVIN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER ANESTOR FORMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
1993-147149-0029 IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMONS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR AND HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPER YET KIND DRESSMAKER
1993-147149-0030 BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS IT IS HEARTTENED GLOOMY PERSON
1993-147964-0000 THEY SET ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GRACING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLAITING WHIP LASHES
1993-147964-0001 ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIT
1993-147964-0002 I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YOLKAH AND ANTONIA EVEN YOLCO WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
1993-147964-0003 SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SOW THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
1993-147964-0004 ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARTS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SPUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
1993-147964-0006 I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAAK
1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELD MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EUVE
1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STEEP ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JANE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURE SO RUDELY MOLDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE
1993-147965-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING HIS WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
1993-147965-0001 MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
1993-147965-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR INDOSTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USES
1993-147965-0004 ALL AFTERNOON HE SAW IN THE DINING ROOM
1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER MACMURDO WEARING HIS RABBIT'SKIN CABIN COLLAR AND NEWMENTS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
1993-147965-0006 HE SAT STILL AND PASTIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
1993-147965-0007 HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SIT PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER KNEE PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEARS DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY FLESH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMOIL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSISSMURDO HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS IN CURTAINS IN FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN AMVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE

2035-147960-0000 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROJECTING MANNER
2035-147960-0001 THE CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER
2035-147960-0002 ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE CHIMERRATOS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSH NEEDED
2035-147960-0003 THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEAVY AS WIND
2035-147960-0004 IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVELED BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE
2035-147960-0005 I CURLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN
2035-147960-0006 I KNOW I'M MOST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
2035-147960-0007 I NEVER KNOW IT WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
2035-147960-0008 A FAINT FETTED SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUIDOOSED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
2035-147960-0009 LOOK TOMMY THAT'S HIS PRISON I SAID
2035-147960-0010 I EXPLAINED IT ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO IN INDIAN TIMES
2035-147960-0011 WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE BOOT HOME AND I WOULD WALK

2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GAVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOLNUTS FOR US
2035-147961-0003 WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT STOP
2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAWL
2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GROCER WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES ON THE MAN IN THE BED
2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELLED SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DISPATCHED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
2035-147961-0009 THE THICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST

2035-147961-0011 PERFECTLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY WAITING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
2035-147961-0013 ANSTEIO'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
2035-147961-0014 FROM OUR BENS SHE WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE'S BODY WAS

2035-152373-0002 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DURIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MORA
2035-152373-0003 THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS WONDERFUL DAY
2035-152373-0004 LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY RODE JOYTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE
2035-152373-0005 IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SON GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEART STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BELLE MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HONORAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE

2035-152373-0011 THE BARE AND ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH IN MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS
2035-152373-0012 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FOR MY HONOUR HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIAN'S TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL
2035-152373-0013 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEEK THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONET WAS PITCHED ON THE WRATH OF TARRA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
2035-152373-0014 SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITYFFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE
2035-152373-0015 HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPORT

2086-149214-0001 IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINEATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE REENTLESSLY TO IMPAL THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PEN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE

2086-149214-0004 HE TRUSTED NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATEING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
2086-149220-0000 THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGHWOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUT BUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET
2086-149220-0001 THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSE BUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND THE PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMPSEN TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRANT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT IMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS

2086-149220-0013 SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONOURED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED AND THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY
