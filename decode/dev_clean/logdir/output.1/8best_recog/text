1272-128104-0000 MISTER GILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL
1272-128104-0001 NOR IS MISTER CUTTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER
1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILIES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
1272-128104-0003 HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LATETON'S WORK IS READY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITHICA
1272-128104-0004 LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND ADAM PAINTINGS AND MASONS EXQUISITE ITALS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGLE PALM MISTER BERCKET FOSTERS LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS CIGARETTE A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS OUR HOW DELICATE IN EXPRESSION
1272-128104-0006 ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER KILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FURNISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE FACT
1272-128104-0008 AS FOR ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FALLEN
1272-128104-0009 HE LIMITS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN RECORD OF ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES A CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING A POSTER
1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE GENTLE BOARD
1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNIZING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FULL OF THIS GRACE THAT MANY FACES OF FEELING
1272-128104-0012 ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES EAT GOOD
1272-128104-0013 MISTER KILTER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE COVER OF PAINTING
1272-128104-0014 BY HERY CULTER M A

1272-135031-0003 THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAPIDS AND OPENED THE DOOR
1272-135031-0004 THE KING HAS FLED A DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
1272-135031-0005 I BEGGED RGADO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO

1272-135031-0008 I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHABGGY
1272-135031-0009 HE DOESN'T WORK IT ALL
1272-135031-0010 IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR GNOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WERERIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
1272-135031-0011 NOT EXACTLY RETURNED CALLICO
1272-135031-0012 THERE IS MY BROTHER NOW
1272-135031-0013 INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE MENTAL FOREST

1272-135031-0015 THE MIDDLE FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOOMED TO CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED CALICO
1272-135031-0016 CALIGO HESITATED
1272-135031-0017 HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVERY ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS
1272-135031-0018 AH NOW I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T
1272-135031-0019 THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BEDSY THOUGHTFULLY
1272-135031-0020 I DON'T BELIEVE ANNE KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHOULD HAVE WORKED BEFORE
1272-135031-0021 I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAKIE
1272-135031-0022 TRUE AGREED TALLICO
1272-135031-0023 CALICO WENT TO THE BIG GUN AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS BURGUDOER USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
1272-135031-0024 HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN CALICO FIRST POUNDED THE GUN AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RIGAT'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
1272-141231-0000 A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSITY SIR I EXIST
1272-141231-0001 SWEAT COVERED BRIGON'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHTLYING CLASS OF AS THE ONLY GARMENTS HE WORE
1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING MARIONA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
1272-141231-0003 HIS INSTANT PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLUE HIGH ON HIS CHEST
1272-141231-0004 ONE KNIT A VOICE SAID AND A TIME BUZZER SOUNDED
1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE AS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT
1272-141231-0006 THE BUZZERERS WERE TRIGGERD HIS MUSCLES IN COMPLETE RELAXATION
1272-141231-0007 ONLY THESE HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE
1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN RIVERIE SLIDING ALONG THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS AND THE TWENTYES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS AND ADORITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICS WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNATCHED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND
1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRAND IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOW STAND A SIDE
1272-141231-0013 THE TWENTYERS
1272-141231-0014 YOU MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY BUT THAT WAY THERE BEING NO FOOL OUT
1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING GRAHAM WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
1272-141231-0016 THAN SECONDS
1272-141231-0017 HE ASKED THE HANDLAER WHO WAS NEEDING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE SCORE OF ENERGY
1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCEING
1272-141231-0020 JUST THRUST AND PERRY AND VICTORY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER
1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO UNDER THE TWENTIETHS HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS
1272-141231-0022 IT APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH DRAMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE
1272-141231-0023 THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOMEONE IN A TANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
1272-141231-0024 THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND CONSCIOUS
1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTY SIX IN DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY FRANZ SOFTLY SPOKE THE UTTER HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERD THE PROCESS
1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FLUIL FROM HIS SECOND STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
1272-141231-0028 I ROLLED UP AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
1272-141231-0029 HE SAID IT WAS LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSELY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
1272-141231-0030 PREEN SAW SOMETHING CLOSE PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN A MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR
1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROG RE INCENSED IT AND KNEW THAT FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
1272-141231-0032 THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUSTED A SIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF EARNEST DATSON ET CETERA
1462-170138-0001 HEW'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
1462-170138-0002 I HAPPEN TO HAVE MAC CALL'S BOX FOR TO NIGHT OR THAT'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
1462-170138-0003 ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED LOUDLY
1462-170138-0004 MYSELF I ALWAYS DID SHE HAD IT IN HER
1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MEAN HALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANDSOME AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE CITY BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S INTENTION TO THE STAGE
1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HELD IT IS IRISH THEIR PROGOINS HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
1462-170138-0009 ITS DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSON'S WHICH SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILIP'S BURROW WHERE SHE SAT SITTING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PREMOISES FOR HER DONKEY
1462-170138-0012 MACUMAL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARLEY ALEXANDER
1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A ROW FACE
1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT
1462-170138-0015 I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE SURE THAT THERE'S NEVER THAN ANY ONE ELSE
1462-170138-0016 HE'S ANOTHER HE'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1462-170138-0017 SIR HARRY TOWN BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKA
1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMOUSLY TOIGHT ISN'T SHE
1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEETY POOR CHILD
1462-170138-0020 A LITTLE TALK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAIN HALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMANE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MOUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOLL
1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER ALIGHTED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HARVEY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAM'S FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PAINTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA
1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELP HER OWN SENSE
1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY HAD EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY
1462-170142-0000 THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BROUGHTLY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND HUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
1462-170142-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN I ENTERED
1462-170142-0004 A COOL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HIMSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND TIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DEEMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARLY
1462-170142-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARILY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
1462-170142-0009 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD RUSHED FORWARD LIKE A CATHOLD IN LEAF
1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTON SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
1462-170142-0011 HE POLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
1462-170142-0012 HELEN WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GOING ABOUT HER EYES
1462-170142-0013 IT HASN'T ALWAYS READ YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
1462-170142-0014 ALWAYS BUT ITS WORSE NOW
1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TOWARDS ME EVERY MINUTE
1462-170142-0016 I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LEGS HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
1462-170142-0017 I'D GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYBODY
1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HELP HIS FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIP LASH
1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED LIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOMEONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
1462-170142-0022 SHE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
1462-170142-0023 I IF THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
1462-170142-0024 AFTER THE FIRST
1462-170142-0025 HELD HIS EYES QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
1462-170142-0026 HE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR TRUUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TWO
1462-170142-0028 PRESENTLY IT STOOL BACK TO HIS COAT'S SLEEVE
1462-170142-0029 YES OLDER I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND PARLEY I WAS WRONG
1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY THAT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
1462-170142-0032 YOU BOUGHT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
1462-170142-0033 BARDLY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
1462-170142-0034 IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA
1462-170142-0035 I'LL BARLEY WHAT AM I TO TWO
1462-170142-0036 YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAKE FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
1462-170142-0037 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINBLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
1462-170142-0038 HELD US SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
1462-170142-0039 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVED YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
1462-170142-0040 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARRING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
1462-170142-0041 SHE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
1462-170142-0042 DONT CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
1462-170145-0000 ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE CONTEMPLATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GUILTY MIRROR
1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND ACROSS THE ROOM QUICKLY
1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OPEN THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHEN YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY AREOOZING WATER
1462-170145-0006 IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED TO ME OR ANY THING
1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WAS REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
1462-170145-0008 HE PAUSED THAT NEVER DID TO ME
1462-170145-0009 O BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME
1462-170145-0010 FALANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
1462-170145-0011 I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE BECOMING
1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HIS HAIR
1462-170145-0013 AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE DOING THAT
1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I CAME BY THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
1462-170145-0015 IVE BEEN UP AND CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
1462-170145-0016 AND WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
1462-170145-0017 I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE TO LONDON
1462-170145-0018 ONLY YOU'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
1462-170145-0020 YESTERDAY YES I KNOW VERY WELL
1462-170145-0021 GRANDEUR FLUSHED ANGRILY
1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T ARE N'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
1673-143396-0000 A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FIRST PROSPECT HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBEIANITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARINES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES
1673-143396-0001 THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY HOLDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1673-143396-0002 YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SEARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0003 HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE ACROSS
1673-143396-0004 HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SACRITIES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
1673-143396-0005 THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFIBLE OPERATION OF A HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
1673-143396-0006 NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE BUT THE FIRST OF THESE ANNES THE LOGOTHS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE BUT THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
1673-143396-0007 BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT TRAGEDY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
1673-143396-0008 MANY AMONG THE GENTLE PRIZE LIGHTS REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABSORBED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0009 HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OBNIPTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
1673-143396-0010 BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOSITE WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCURUPTABLE BODY
1673-143396-0011 A FEEDNESS THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
1673-143396-0012 IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARRIED BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENTS TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY
1673-143396-0013 WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE CLARAMA OR A WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
1673-143396-0014 BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FEET OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PERFANE
1673-143396-0015 THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CURRENTIUS
1673-143396-0016 THE WORTHY FRIEND OF AFHANASIUS BUT WERE THE ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARERIANS AND POLOTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
1673-143396-0017 YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED OF HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARRESS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION
