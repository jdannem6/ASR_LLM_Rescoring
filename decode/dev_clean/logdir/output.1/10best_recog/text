1272-128104-0000 MISTER QUIILTER IS THE APOSTTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL
1272-128104-0001 NOR IS MISTER QUILTTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER
1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIB SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILIES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
1272-128104-0003 HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LADTON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITTHICCA
1272-128104-0004 LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND ADAM PAINTINGS AND MASONS EXQUISITE ITALS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGLE PALM MISTER BERCKET FOSTERS LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAYS THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS CENTRE A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A CHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE SO DELICATE IN EXPRESSION
1272-128104-0006 ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART AND MISTER QUIILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE A FACT
1272-128104-0008 AS FOR  ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN
1272-128104-0009 HE LIMITS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN SECRET OF ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES A CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING A POSTER
1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON A MENTAL BOARD
1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNIZING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND OFFICE OF HIS GRACE THAT MANY FACES OF FEELING
1272-128104-0012 ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES GET GOODNESS
1272-128104-0013 MISTER GILTER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE TEMPER OF PAINTING
1272-128104-0014 BY HEROIC CILTER M A
1272-135031-0000 BECAUSE YOU ARE SLEEPING AND SON OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW O POOR A SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOLING DOVE
1272-135031-0001 HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLLY ROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST
1272-135031-0002 I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST A STOUT CHANGE AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS
1272-135031-0003 THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAFTS AND OPENED THE DOOR
1272-135031-0004 THE KING IS FLED OF DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
1272-135031-0005 I BEGGED RIGATO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO
1272-135031-0006 I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT I WOULD NOT GO
1272-135031-0007 HE AIDS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING
1272-135031-0008 I HOPE HE DOESN N'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGY
1272-135031-0009 HE DOESN' A WORK AT ALL
1272-135031-0010 IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR ROOMS WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
1272-135031-0011 NOT EXACTLY RETURNED CARICO
1272-135031-0012 WHERE IS MY BROTHER NAIL
1272-135031-0013 INQUIRED SHAGGING IN THE MIDDLE FOREST
1272-135031-0014 WHERE IS NOT
1272-135031-0015 THE MIDDLE FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOOMED KAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED CALICO
1272-135031-0016 CALIJO HESITATED
1272-135031-0017 HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WEIGHS
1272-135031-0018 OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DI N
1272-135031-0019 THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED TO BED SEAT THOUGHTFULLY
1272-135031-0020 I DON'T BELIEVE ANNE KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SEAT OFVERTED BEFORE
1272-135031-0021 I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHABGGY
1272-135031-0022 TRUE AGREED PALICO
1272-135031-0023 CALICO WENT TO THE BIG GANG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS BURGUDOLY USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
1272-135031-0024 HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN CALICO FIRST POUNDED THE GUN AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RIGADO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGED WHO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
1272-141231-0000 A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I CONSIST
1272-141231-0001 SWEPT COVERED BRIGON'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHTLYING CLASS OF AS THE ONLY GARMENTS HE WORE
1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERESTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING MARINA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
1272-141231-0003 ITS INSTANT PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST
1272-141231-0004 ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND A TIME BUZSER SOUNDED
1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF
1272-141231-0006 THE BUZERS WERE TRIGGERD AS MUSCLES IN COMPLETE RELAXATION
1272-141231-0007 ONLY HIS HEARTED LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE
1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN RIVERY SLIDING AROUND THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS AND THE TWENTYIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS AND A DOMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO UNDER THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE PUPILS WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HOARSE URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND
1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRAND IS THE WHEN I MUST SEE NO STAND ASIDE
1272-141231-0013 THE TWENTY THREE
1272-141231-0014 YOU MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY BUT THAT AWAY HERE BE NO FOOL OUT
1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING GRINON WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
1272-141231-0016 THIN SECONDS
1272-141231-0017 HE ASKED THE HANDLER WHO WAS NEEDING HIS ACHING VESSELS
1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WHICH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF ENERGY
1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF OFFENSING
1272-141231-0020 JUST THRUST AND PERRY AND VICTORYING TO THE STRONGER
1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO UTTERED THE TWENTYS HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS
1272-141231-0022 THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WAS THE DEATH DRAMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LENGTHED INTO ONE
1272-141231-0023 THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOMEONE IN A TRENCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
1272-141231-0024 THIS WAS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS
1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTY YEARS AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY GRAHAM SOFTLY SPOKE THE UTTER HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERD TO PROCESS
1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS SOIL FROM HIS SECOND STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
1272-141231-0028 I ROLLED CLOAK AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
1272-141231-0029 HE SAID IT WAS A LAST THIRST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSELY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
1272-141231-0030 GRAHAM SAW SOMETHING CLOSE PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN A MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR
1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROGUE RE ENCENSED IT AND KNEW THAT THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
1272-141231-0032 THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUST A SIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF EARNEST DALSON ET CETERA
1462-170138-0001 YOU'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
1462-170138-0002 I HAPPEN TO HAVE MAC MAMMA'S BOX FOR TO NIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
1462-170138-0003 ALEXANDRIA EXCLAIMED MILDLY
1462-170138-0004 HIMSELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER REHNHJELM LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANDSOME AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SEA IN BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDR'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HELD IT IS IRISH THEIR BUGOINS HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
1462-170138-0009 IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN OUR LONDON THEATRE
1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSUONS WHICH SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF BILLY'S BURROW WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PREMOISES FOR HER DONKEY
1462-170138-0012 MACCOMA LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARLEY ALEXANDER
1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MANHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A DRY FACE
1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DEDGING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT
1462-170138-0015 I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TOO THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE
1462-170138-0016 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S SOFTLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1462-170138-0017 SIR HARRY TONGUE BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKIA
1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR PARRY THE LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEA POOR CHILD
1462-170138-0020 LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARDING BELL RANG AND MAIN HALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTONE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MOUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWL
1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGING WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLATED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE UNCONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH THE AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAM'S FORLICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HELDDA
1462-170138-0026 IM GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SENSE
1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNGER AND KINDLY
1462-170142-0000 THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE MARKEDLY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGGED CENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMPLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
1462-170142-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED AND
1462-170142-0004 A CALM FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GREAT AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHAT SHE DID IT
1462-170142-0006 SHE NEARLY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY ENJOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLY
1462-170142-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME ARTLY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
1462-170142-0009 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD FRESHED FORWARD LIKE A CAPITALD IN LEAF
1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISHED ME TO BARLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
1462-170142-0011 HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE EMPTY
1462-170142-0012 SYLVIA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
1462-170142-0013 IT HASN'T ALWAYS KNOWN YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
1462-170142-0014 ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE KNOWN
1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
1462-170142-0016 I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVEROUSLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
1462-170142-0017 I YET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECETION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HELD HER FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIP LASH
1462-170142-0020 SHE BEAT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY ARTLY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
1462-170142-0022 HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS TERROR BY THE FIRE
1462-170142-0023 I' HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
1462-170142-0024 AFTER THEY VERY FIRST
1462-170142-0025 BEHELD HIS FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
1462-170142-0026 SHE PRESSED HER HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR CHUBBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO
1462-170142-0028 PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT'S LOAF
1462-170142-0029 YES HULLO I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND BARLEY I WAS LONG
1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAAKING OF HIS CHAIR
1462-170142-0032 YOU WON ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
1462-170142-0033 BARTON LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
1462-170142-0034 IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILD A
1462-170142-0035 I'LL BARLY WHAT AM I TO DO
1462-170142-0036 YOU WANT ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
1462-170142-0037 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE THAT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
1462-170142-0038 HELD HER SET ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
1462-170142-0039 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
1462-170142-0040 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DISTANCE
1462-170142-0041 SHE SLED TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
1462-170142-0042 WON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
1462-170145-0000 ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRUCK COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MURMUR
1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND COCKED THE ROOM QUICKLY
1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OVER ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE HE WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THERE OZING WATER
1462-170145-0006 IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONE'D TO ME OR ANYTHING
1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
1462-170145-0008 SHE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
1462-170145-0009 O BARLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME
1462-170145-0010 ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOVE HER
1462-170145-0011 I THINK I HA FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HIS HAIR
1462-170145-0013 IN I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I BECAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
1462-170145-0015 I'VE BEEN UP ON CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
1462-170145-0016 OM WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
1462-170145-0017 I'AM GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
1462-170145-0018 ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETE'LY
1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
1462-170145-0020 YET YES I KNOW VERY WELL
1462-170145-0021 ALEXANDR FLUSHED ANGRILY
1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T HAVEN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
1673-143396-0000 A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FIRST PROSPECT HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIONITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARINES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES
1673-143396-0001 THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOLED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1673-143396-0002 YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE INQUIRIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0003 HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATUER AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
1673-143396-0004 HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SACRATIES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
1673-143396-0005 THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF A HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADDOM
1673-143396-0006 NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE BUT THE FIRST OF THESE INANDS THE LOGOTHS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
1673-143396-0007 BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT PROBLEM OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
1673-143396-0008 MANY AMONG THE GENTLE PRESOLITES REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABSORBED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0009 HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
1673-143396-0010 BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOSEIT WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCORUPTABLE BODY
1673-143396-0011 A FEEDISTIC THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
1673-143396-0012 IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENTS TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME PIITY
1673-143396-0013 WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS A CHRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE CLARAMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
1673-143396-0014 BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FETE OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE
1673-143396-0015 THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CURRENTS
1673-143396-0016 THE WORTHY FRIEND OF AFHANASIUS BUT WERE THE ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARERIANS AND POLOTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOUR OF GEOMETICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
1673-143396-0017 YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED OF HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLNAIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION
