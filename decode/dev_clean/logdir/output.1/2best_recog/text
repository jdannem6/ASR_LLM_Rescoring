1272-128104-0000 MISTER KILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL
1272-128104-0001 NOR IS MISTER QUARTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER
1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROSE BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILIES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
1272-128104-0003 HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LADTON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITHICA
1272-128104-0004 LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND ADAM PAINTINGS AND MASONS EXQUISITE ITALS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGLE PALM MISTER BERCKET FOSTERS LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS CENTRE A CHEERFUL SLAP IN THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE HOW DELICATE AND EXPRESSION
1272-128104-0006 ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART AND MISTER KILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE EFFECT
1272-128104-0008 AS FOR ETCHINGS THERE ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN
1272-128104-0009 HE LIMITS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES A CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING A POSTER
1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE MENTALBOARD
1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNIZING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FULLS OF HIS GRACE THAT MANY FACES OF FEELING
1272-128104-0012 ONLY FORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES GET GOOD
1272-128104-0013 MISTER CILTER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE TEMPER OF PAINTING
1272-128104-0014 BY HEROIC CILTER M A
1272-135031-0000 BECAUSE YOU ARE SLEEPING AND SAID OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW O POOR A SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOLING DOVE
1272-135031-0001 HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLLY GROOM WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST
1272-135031-0002 I HAVE REMAINED THE PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS
1272-135031-0003 THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAPS AND OPENED THE DOOR
1272-135031-0004 THE KING HAS FLED DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
1272-135031-0005 I BEGGED REGIGO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO
1272-135031-0006 I ALSO OFFER TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE WOULD NOT GO
1272-135031-0007 HE EATS IN SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING
1272-135031-0008 I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGING
1272-135031-0009 HE DOES'T WORK AT ALL
1272-135031-0010 IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR KNOWNS WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
1272-135031-0011 NOT EXACTLY RETURNED TELLICO
1272-135031-0012 WHERE'S MY BROTHER NOW
1272-135031-0013 INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE METAL FOREST
1272-135031-0014 WHAT IS THAT
1272-135031-0015 THE METAL FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED CALICO
1272-135031-0016 CALIO HESITATED
1272-135031-0017 HOWEVER IF WE LOOKS SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS
1272-135031-0018 AH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T
1272-135031-0019 THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED TO BEDSY THOUGHTFULLY
1272-135031-0020 I DON'T BELIEVE ANNE KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE VERTED BEFORE
1272-135031-0021 I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGING
1272-135031-0022 TRUE AGREED CALLICO
1272-135031-0023 CALICO WENT TO THE BIG GUN AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS BURGUDOLY USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
1272-135031-0024 HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN CALICO FIRST POUNDED THE GUN AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RIGAT'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
1272-141231-0000 A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXISTENCE
1272-141231-0001 SWEPT COVERED BRIGON'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHTLYING CLASS OF AS THE ONLY GARMENT HE WORE
1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING MARIANA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
1272-141231-0003 HIS INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST
1272-141231-0004 ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND A TIME BUZER SOUNDED
1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HAS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT
1272-141231-0006 THE BUZZERS WERE TRIGGERD HIS MUSCLES IN COMPLETE RELAXATION
1272-141231-0007 ONLY AS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE
1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING ALONG THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS AND THE TWENTYIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS AND DOMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED A COMMAND
1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRAND IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOT STAND ASIDE
1272-141231-0013 THE TWENTY'S
1272-141231-0014 YOU MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY BUT THAT A WAY THERE BE NO FOOL OUT
1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING GRINN WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
1272-141231-0016 THEN SECONDS
1272-141231-0017 HE ASKED THE HANDLER WHO IS NEEDING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORY OF ENERGY
1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OFENSING
1272-141231-0020 JUST THRUST AND PERRY AND VICTIM TO THE STRONGER
1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTYES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS
1272-141231-0022 THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WAS THE DEATH DRAMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE
1272-141231-0023 THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOME ONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
1272-141231-0024 THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUSNESS
1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING A TWENTIETH AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY BRILLIANT SOFTLY SPOKE THE UTTER HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERD THE PROCESS
1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FORIL FROM HIS SECOND STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
1272-141231-0028 I ROLLED LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
1272-141231-0029 HE SAID IT WAS THE LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSELY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
1272-141231-0030 BRUN SAW SOMETHING CLOSE PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN A MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR
1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROGUE RE INCENSED IT AND KNEW THAT FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
1272-141231-0032 THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUSTED ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF EARNEST DOUBTSON ET CETERA
1462-170138-0001 HE'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSABLE
1462-170138-0002 I HAPPENED TO HAVE MAC CALL'S BOX FOR TO NIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
1462-170138-0003 ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED WILDLY
1462-170138-0004 MYSELF I ALWAYS KNOW SHE HAD IT IN HER
1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MEANTIME LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANDSOME AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE THROUGH ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HELD IT IS IRISH THEIR BRGOINES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
1462-170138-0009 IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSOONS WHICH SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILIP'S BURROUGH WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PREMOISES FOR HER DONKEY
1462-170138-0012 MACAMAL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARLEY ALEXANDER
1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A RIRY FACE
1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING ACQUAINTANCE AS HE WENT
1462-170138-0015 I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE
1462-170138-0016 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KING ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1462-170138-0017 SIR HARRY TOWN BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKIO
1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMOUSLY TONIGHT ISN'T SHE
1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY POOR CHILD
1462-170138-0020 THE LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAIN HALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMIRE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MOUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWL
1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLATED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HENRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAM'S FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HELDA
1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY
1462-170142-0000 THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARLY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGED SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UP STAIRS
1462-170142-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHAT HE ENTERED
1462-170142-0004 A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GREAT AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELL A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DEEMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARLEY
1462-170142-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME PARTLY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
1462-170142-0009 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD RUSHED FORWARD LIKE A CAPITALD IN LEAF
1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARLY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
1462-170142-0011 HE PULLED UP THE WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
1462-170142-0012 FIDDLER WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
1462-170142-0013 IT HASN'T ALWAYS MEANS YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
1462-170142-0014 ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORST NOW
1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTES
1462-170142-0016 I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TOO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
1462-170142-0017 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERABLE OUT OF EITHER
1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERY THING
1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HIS FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIP LASH
1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASSED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
1462-170142-0022 HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIR
1462-170142-0023 I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT TILL I AM WORN OUT
1462-170142-0024 AFTER THAT VERY FIRST
1462-170142-0025 HELD THIS FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
1462-170142-0026 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE AREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TWO
1462-170142-0028 PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT'S SLEEVE
1462-170142-0029 YES SHOULDER I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND BARLY I WAS WRONG
1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENSELY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
1462-170142-0032 YOU OUGHT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
1462-170142-0033 BARLY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
1462-170142-0034 IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HELDER
1462-170142-0035 OH BARLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
1462-170142-0036 YOU ASK ME TO STARE AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
1462-170142-0037 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINEABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
1462-170142-0038 HELD A SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
1462-170142-0039 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MIX THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
1462-170142-0040 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CAREING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
1462-170142-0041 SHE FLED TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
1462-170142-0042 DON'T TRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
1462-170145-0000 ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKING COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T ONLY THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHAT YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY ARE OZING WATER
1462-170145-0006 IF YOU'D SET ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED TO ME OR ANYTHING
1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINK OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
1462-170145-0008 HE PAUSED THEY NEVER SAID TO ME
1462-170145-0009 OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME
1462-170145-0010 ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARMS ABOUT HER
1462-170145-0011 I THINK I HAD FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HEAD
1462-170145-0013 AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELINGS THAT
1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I CAME MY THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
1462-170145-0015 I'VE BEEN UP AND CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
1462-170145-0016 THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
1462-170145-0017 I' AM GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
1462-170145-0018 ONLY ILL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
1462-170145-0020 YES I KNEW VERY WELL
1462-170145-0021 ALEXANDER BLUSHED ANGRILY
1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU CHARMING TO FRIGHTEN ME
1673-143396-0000 A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FIRST PRESIDENT HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIONITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARINES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES
1673-143396-0001 THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOLDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1673-143396-0002 YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE LUXURIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0003 HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASED IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
1673-143396-0004 HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SACRTIES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
1673-143396-0005 THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF A HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ATOM
1673-143396-0006 NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE BUT THE FIRST OF THESE ANNES THE LOGOTHS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
1673-143396-0007 BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT PROPERTY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
1673-143396-0008 MANY AMONG THE GENTLE PROSLIGHTS REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABSORBED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0009 HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OBNIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
1673-143396-0010 BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOCEIT WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCURUPTABLE BODY
1673-143396-0011 A FEEDIST THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
1673-143396-0012 IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MERRY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENTS TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY
1673-143396-0013 WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AND IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE CLARAMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
1673-143396-0014 BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FEAT OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE
1673-143396-0015 THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CURRENT THIS
1673-143396-0016 THE WORTHY FRIEND OF AFHANASIUS BUT WERE THE ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARERIANS AND POLOTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITTLE AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
1673-143396-0017 YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED OF HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE IN EXPLANATION
1673-143396-0018 HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOW GOSSIP FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE

174-84280-0000 HOW WE MUST SIMPLEIFY
174-84280-0001 IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST IS DISCORDANT WITH THE VASTNESS AND VARIETY THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AND RECUPERATIONS OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IT TO DAY
174-84280-0002 IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRUDER AND MORE RIGID CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NAIVELY AGED SOONER AND DIED YOUNGER THAN WE DO
174-84280-0003 WE RANGE WHITER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPE MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING
174-84280-0004 AND ALREADY THIS ASTOUNDING BLOW BEGINS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG OTHER EVENTS AS A THING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE INDEED BUT RELATED TO ALL THE STRANGENESS AND MYSTERY OF LIFE PART OF THE UNIVERSAL MYSTERIES OF DESPAIR AND FUTILITY AND DEATH THAT HAVE TROUBLED BY CONSCIOUSNESS AND CHILDHOOD

174-84280-0012 AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NUT OF ANIMAL JEALOUSIES AND THOUGHTLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGID INSTITUTIONS THAT I WOULD END THIS WRITING
174-84280-0013 IN MARRY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WOMANHOOD AND FELLOWSHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE DREAMT OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLUTCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSSESSION
174-84280-0014 WHAT ALTERNATIVE WAS THEREFORE HER
174-84280-0015 SHE WAS DESTROYED NOT MERELY BY THE UNCONSIDERED UNDISIPLIN PASSIONS OF HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVER BUT BY THE VAST TRADITION THAT SUSTAINS AND ENFORCES THE SUBJUGATION OF HER SEX
