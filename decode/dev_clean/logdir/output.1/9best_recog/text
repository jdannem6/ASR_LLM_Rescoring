1272-128104-0000 MISTER CHILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL
1272-128104-0001 NOR IS MISTER SCULTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER
1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIV SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILIES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
1272-128104-0003 HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FRANCIS LATON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITTHICA
1272-128104-0004 LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND ADAM PAINTINGS AND MASONS EXQUISITE ITALS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGLE PALM MISTER BERCKET FOSTERS LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS CENTRE A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMP WHOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THE CRITICISMS ARE HOW DELICATE IN EXPRESSION
1272-128104-0006 ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER CRILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE FIGHT
1272-128104-0008 AS FOR ITCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN
1272-128104-0009 HE LIMITS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES A CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING A POSTERER
1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIR AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE MENTAL BOARD
1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNIZING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FULLS OF THIS GRACE THAT MANY FACES OF FEELING
1272-128104-0012 ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORKING NEVER DOES GET GOOD
1272-128104-0013 MISTER KILTER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE PEPPER OF PAINTING
1272-128104-0014 BY HEROICULTER M A
1272-135031-0000 BECAUSE YOU ARE SLEEPING AND SET OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW OR POOR A SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOLING DOVE
1272-135031-0001 HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLY CROW WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST
1272-135031-0002 I HAVE REMAINED THE PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DREADS
1272-135031-0003 THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE WRAPPEDS AND OPENED THE DOOR
1272-135031-0004 THE KING HAS FLED TO DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
1272-135031-0005 I BEGGED REGIGO A LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO
1272-135031-0006 I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE THAT HE WOULD NOT GO
1272-135031-0007 HE EATS AND ASLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING
1272-135031-0008 I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGED
1272-135031-0009 HE DOESN'S WORK AT ALL
1272-135031-0010 IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR GNOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSI
1272-135031-0011 NOT EXACTLY RETURNED CALICA
1272-135031-0012 WHERE IS MY BROTHER NAY
1272-135031-0013 INQUIRED SHAKIE IN THE MIDDLE FOREST
1272-135031-0014 WHERE WAS THAT
1272-135031-0015 THE MIDDLE FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOONED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED CALICO
1272-135031-0016 CALAICO HESITATED
1272-135031-0017 HOWEVER IF WE FEEL SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS
1272-135031-0018 AH I'M QUITE SURE HE DID
1272-135031-0019 THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED TO BES HE THOUGHTFULLY
1272-135031-0020 I DON'T BELIEVE ANNE KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D OF VERTED BEFORE
1272-135031-0021 I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGED
1272-135031-0022 TWO AGREED CALICO
1272-135031-0023 CALICO WENT TO THE BIG GANG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS BURGARDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
1272-135031-0024 HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN CALICO FIRST POUNDED THE GUN AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RIGADO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDAU HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
1272-141231-0000 AMAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST
1272-141231-0001 SWEAT COVERED BRION'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHTLYING CLASS OF AS THE ONLY GIRLMAN HE WORE
1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING AREINA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
1272-141231-0003 HIS INSTANTIVE PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST
1272-141231-0004 ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND A TIME BUZZ SOUNDED
1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRAUCTION OF IT
1272-141231-0006 THE BUZZERERS WERE TRIGGERD AS MUSCLES AND COMPLETE RELAXATION
1272-141231-0007 ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED GREAT
1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING AROUND THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS AND THE TWENTYIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS AND ADOMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A RASH URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND
1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRAND IS THE WHEN I MUST SEE NOT STAND ASIDE
1272-141231-0013 THE TWENTY SIX
1272-141231-0014 YOU MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY BUT THAT AWAY THERE BEING NO FOOL OUT
1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING GRINNED WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
1272-141231-0016 DIM SECONDS
1272-141231-0017 HE ASKED THE HANDLOR WHO IS NEEDING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WENT AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF ENERGY
1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND EFFENSING
1272-141231-0020 JUST THRUST AND PERRY AND VICTORY OF THE STRONGER
1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIETH HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS
1272-141231-0022 THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WAS THE DEATH PHENOMENA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE
1272-141231-0023 THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOMEONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED ACCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
1272-141231-0024 THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONTRARY
1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING A TWENTY EIGHTH AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY FRANCE SOFTLY SPOKE THE UTTER HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERD THE PROCESS
1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZARD SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM HIS SECOND STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
1272-141231-0028 I ROLLED THE AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
1272-141231-0029 HE SAID IT WAS A LAST BIRTH OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSELY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
1272-141231-0030 PREUN SAW SOMETHING CLOSE PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN A MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR
1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROG RE INCENSED IT AND KNEW THAT THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
1272-141231-0032 THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUST A SIDE IN AN UNDER THE GUARD
1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF EARNEST DASON ET CETERA
1462-170138-0001 HE IS WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
1462-170138-0002 I HAPPEN TO HAVE MAC CALLEL'S BOX FOR TO NIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
1462-170138-0003 DANGLARS EXCLAIMED MILDLY
1462-170138-0004 MYSELF I ALWAYS WHOM SHE HAD IT IN HER
1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER NED HALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANDSOME AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDERWAY THE SEA BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BOAST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HELD IT IS IRISH THEIR BEGOINS HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
1462-170138-0009 IS DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN HER LONDON THEATRE
1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSZOONS WHICH SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF BILLY'S BURROUGH WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PREMOISES FOR HER DONKEY
1462-170138-0012 MACUNDEL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARLEY ALEXANDER
1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A RIPE FACE
1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGEING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT
1462-170138-0015 I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE SURE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE HOUSE
1462-170138-0016 HE'S OTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1462-170138-0017 SIR HATRY TOWN BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKIA
1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT DIDN'T SHE
1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SILLY POOR CHILD
1462-170138-0020 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLEY
1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAIN HALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMIRE OF COURSE THE STEEPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MOUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWL
1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGING WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CAUTIOUSLY RECALLING WITH THE AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMS FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULLESS WITH EXCITEMENT
1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HALDA
1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD YOU'D HELD HER OWN SENSE
1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY THAT EVERYTHING WAS YOUNGER AND KINDLY
1462-170142-0000 THE LESS TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE PARTLY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGGED SENT TO THE SAVOID AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND HUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
1462-170142-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED IT
1462-170142-0004 A COLD FIRE WAS CRACKING IN THE GREAT AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO BEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY THRUST HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
1462-170142-0007 I NEVER JEEMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARLY
1462-170142-0008 WHERE DID YOU COME BARTLY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
1462-170142-0009 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD RUSHED FORWARD LIKE A CAPITAL TO IN LEAF
1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO ARTLY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
1462-170142-0011 SHE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
1462-170142-0012 HULLO WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GOING ABOUT HER EYES
1462-170142-0013 IT HASN'T ALWAYS MEANT YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
1462-170142-0014 ALWAYS BUT HE'S WORSE NOW
1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABLE ITS TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
1462-170142-0016 I AM NOT THE MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
1462-170142-0017 I DID NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
1462-170142-0018 THERE IS HIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOUR FLASHED BACK INTO HILL HIS FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIP LASH
1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED HEIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
1462-170142-0022 HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY A FIRE
1462-170142-0023 IVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
1462-170142-0024 AFTER THE THREE FIRST
1462-170142-0025 HELD HIS FACE QUIVERERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
1462-170142-0026 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEM AT ALL
1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR CHUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TO
1462-170142-0028 PRESENTLY IT STOOL BACK TO HIS COAT'S LEAF
1462-170142-0029 YES OLIVER I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND BARILY I WAS WRONG
1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT HE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
1462-170142-0032 YOU SOUGHT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
1462-170142-0033 BARLING LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
1462-170142-0034 IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK TIILDA
1462-170142-0035 I LL BARLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
1462-170142-0036 YOU ASK ME TO STAYWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
1462-170142-0037 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOME THING
1462-170142-0038 HELD HIM SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
1462-170142-0039 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU LOOKS THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
1462-170142-0040 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
1462-170142-0041 SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF THEY WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
1462-170142-0042 DON'T CRIME DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
1462-170145-0000 ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIME PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT NEARER
1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND LOST THE ROOM QUICKLY
1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OVER ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY CALLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY ARE OOOZING WATER
1462-170145-0006 IF YE'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED TO ME OR ANYTHING
1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE MERELY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
1462-170145-0008 HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DIED TO ME
1462-170145-0009 OH BARTIE DID YOU WRITE TO ME
1462-170145-0010 ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
1462-170145-0011 I THINK I HAVE HELP THAT YOU WERE COMING
1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIRS
1462-170145-0013 AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT
1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I CAME ON THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
1462-170145-0015 I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I RANG NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
1462-170145-0016 THEM WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY ADMITTED
1462-170145-0017 I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU ARE IN LONDON
1462-170145-0018 ONLY I'LL DO IT MORAL COMPLETELY
1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT
1462-170145-0020 YES I KNOW VERY WELL WITH
1462-170145-0021 ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRY
1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU GOING TO FRIGHTEN ME
1673-143396-0000 A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FIRST PROSPECT HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIANITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARINES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES
1673-143396-0001 THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE TO FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOULDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1673-143396-0002 YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SESERIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0003 HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATUURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
1673-143396-0004 HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRITIES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
1673-143396-0005 THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ATOM
1673-143396-0006 NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE BUT THE FIRST OF THESE INDIANS THE LOGOTHS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
1673-143396-0007 BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT GRAVITY OF MANNER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
1673-143396-0008 MANY AMONG THE GENTLE PRIZELIGHTS REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABSORBED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0009 HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF AMNIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
1673-143396-0010 BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOCEIT WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCORUPTABLE BODY
1673-143396-0011 A FEEDISH THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
1673-143396-0012 IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENT TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY
1673-143396-0013 WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AND IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLAYRAMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
1673-143396-0014 BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FEAR OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE
1673-143396-0015 THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CURRENTRESS
1673-143396-0016 THE WORTHY FRIEND OF AFHANASIUS BUT WERE THE ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARERIANS AND POLOTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOUR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LIBERAL AN ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
1673-143396-0017 YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED OF HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLONARESS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION
1673-143396-0018 HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL INSENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOW GHOSTS FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
1673-143396-0019 BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANTIAL INDESOLUABLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THETERNITY WITH A REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FLESH
