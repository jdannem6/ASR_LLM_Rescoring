7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SEEKS
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HADTH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINBAD THE SAME AND HAD RELIGHTED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINBAED THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD THE SAME IN
7018-75789-0026 NO I COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROPHET I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DIE AND NAUGHT AND I CARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLIDEST SENSE SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SALE THE SISE AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HE AND YOU THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN VIALS A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRIED AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BASSURA TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FORESE AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TAUGHT HIM IN HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS ENOUGH TO TAKE IN REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SIGHT IN THE STERN CLIMBED TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LIFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSAGES AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BID
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SAID AN ASSASSIN WETTERED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WIDING A SHORT TIME SMELLED ANDTICED IT AND THEN HE TOOK CAT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING NO ARE YE PASSAGES THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENUTTING THAT WHO SIR COME TIED I SHALL SURELY DIE WITH THAT TYPE OF A SCIPPOLATE FOR THAT THIS ASSERTION IS COLD THE SEA OF THE CRIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SIPPOCRA OF OUR LORD'S SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BARTHY PACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH READ ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NOR MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH RISE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT RACE THE HORN OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING UNBORN WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OUR MISCONCEPTION AS THE PLEASURE BEST GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINED A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THEIR JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ANY IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SPITE OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF GLEMACY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 I HAD LONG BY THEN ON THE EVE OF A B ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTEING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITH HELD OR EVEN DELAY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE SOCIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND A TAKE MACHINES IN WHITE HALL AND DAWNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTERS
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATH LIKE HUSH

7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF COBONED MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS TRIED BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELIEFS OF LATTER BATH FAILED TO CLASSIFY THEM

7902-96591-0001 DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME
7902-96591-0002 AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOUR
7902-96591-0004 THAT MY FATHER SIR RICHMOND GRAHAM SMUGGLED GOODSIER
7902-96591-0005 HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGERS YOU SHALL NOT TELL

7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHY STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOR PROPER AS THE FRENCH CALLER LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RACE STROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISCHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND SYLVIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP IT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD NOT ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE CAKE HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORE TASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL A MORNING AND MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT SIGNAL FOR HELP MOST OF BOTH CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SOW
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTEL PIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS AND THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEEK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL AND TWO PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THAT HAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU LOOK ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE

7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHERY STROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GUARD TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TONGERTEEL THE BOY WHO HELPS THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID DANDY CALL MISTER YOUR FATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS NAUGHTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AND I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE REEDS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TILL SERVICE AND THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER WROTE
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOTS AGAINST STONE WORK AND GRAHAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MANSHIP INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 ROOM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HULLO HE SAID WHO ARE YOU

7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE CHIMNEY PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVE DIRT GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT IT ONE OF THE BOWS LABOUR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS IN GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GREAT AND EAR SELLING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND BRUSHED BACK THE DARK INTO A SHEATH

7975-280057-0014 BUT SHE FAILED TO FIND THE COMFORT SHE SAW FOR ANNOYANCES CONTINUED IN A MORE AGGRAVATED FORM
7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SIGNING PERSECUTERS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DAY OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS A DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISON BILL SHE WENT TO WAVERLY WHERE SHE WAS HANDED CONTINUALLY
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT IT WASHINGTON WEAKLY

7975-280063-0006 JAGMEN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASON MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FALK SHOULD LET A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPT AT THE PIECES
7975-280063-0007 WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WHERE HELPLESS HAD THE FIGHT BEEN PRESSED
7975-280063-0008 THEY DID MARK MY CLOTHES IN ONE OR TWO PLACES HOWEVER

7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPHERD RED MOCKERS AND BUD PANTS WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH CONTRARY
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAY WAS A COMPANY BUFFALO'S HEAD JUDGEMENT PLAYING THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
7975-280076-0003 THE WAR WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIAL AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
