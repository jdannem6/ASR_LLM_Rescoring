7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SEEKS
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD LOT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HADTH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINBAD THE SAME AND HAD RELIGHTED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFAIL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SIN BAD THE SAME IN
7018-75789-0026 NO I COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROPHET I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DIE AND NAUGHT AND I CARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLAC SENSE SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SALE THE SISE AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HE AND YOU THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BLES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRIED AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BASSURA TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FORESE AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TAUGHT HIM IN HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS ENOUGH TO TAKE IN REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SIGHT IN THE STERN CLIMBED TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LIFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSAGES AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS EYES AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BID
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SAID AN ASSASSIN WETTERED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WIDING A SHORT TIME SMELLED ANDTICED IT AND THEN HE TOOK CAT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING NO ARE YE PASSAGES THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENUTTING THAT WHO SIR COME TIED I SHALL SURELY DIE WITH THAT TYPE OF A SCIPPOLATE FOR THAT THIS ASSERTION IS COLD THE SEA OF THE CRIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A STEPPOCRA OF OUR LORD'S SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BARTHBY PACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH READ ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NO BUT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH RISE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT RIIF THE HORN OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OUR MISCONCEPTION AS THE PROPRIETOR BEST GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY SUMMONED A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 VICTORY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN EQUITAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ANY IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SPITE OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF GLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 I HAD LONG BY THEN ON THE EVE OF A VIOLECION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTEING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITH HELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE SOCIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND TO TAKE MACHINES IN WHITE HALL AND DAWNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES

7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGHISCHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WHARTON CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND SYLVIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE LAID WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESSITIVE PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP IT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORTASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL A MORNING THAT MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT SIGNAL FOR HELP WHILST OF BOTH CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SEW
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTEL PEACE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER BOYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO IT WAS TOO BAD HE CANNOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS AND THE HOES WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEEK IDIOT FUR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO CLASSES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HAND WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODIES THERE THAT HAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO IS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS

7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHER STROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUICK DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GUARD TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEL THE BOY WHO HELPS THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID THATDY CALL MISTER YOUR FATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS NAY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON

7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND GRAHAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN STOOD
7902-96592-0015 ROOM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM A SURPRISE

7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVE DIRT GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT IT ONE OF THE BOUGHS LABOUR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS IN GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GREAT AND EARISTS SELLING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND FLUSHED BACK THE DARK INTO A SHEATH

7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DAY OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON HIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO DATE WAS A DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISON BILL SHE WENT AWAYERLY WHERE SHE WAS HANDED CONTINUALLY
