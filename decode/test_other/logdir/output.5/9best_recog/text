5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS A MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE POSITION ABOVE FLAREF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SIRG EVEN OF IT EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET IT OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET IT IN THE MARTIAN IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARILY TO SECURE VIRAT'S LIKE TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLAROZ LIKE TO VOTE THEM WAS DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM GATHER ASPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHEN THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS ADDED FRESHMEN BAR

5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHALL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY FOR HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDER A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESOLVING THAN I LET THEMSELVES

5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD THEM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A POLICE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD

5442-41169-0014 THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT ARE TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LEANING OUT TO GARDEN CLIMBING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNEW AND THEY YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD THE CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNAWED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T COME DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT TWO BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SHE

5442-41169-0018 OH WELL WHAT DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND ONCE MORE THE LANDLORD WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS IN THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT OF AND YET ONE DOESN'T
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEP UPON MISS LIVERY EVER THINGS WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT TO YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'VE CUT DOWN THE LUXURY
5442-41169-0023 HERE ARE FEW THOUSANDS OF LINES AND EACH WOULD MAKE DOVE GOOD BARRELS A BACH
5442-41169-0024 YOUR MERIT I SHOULD SAID THE LANDORRA
5442-41169-0025 YES EXALD STRANGE WHO WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LANDOR HAD CHUCKLED UP IN HIS WHITE CONSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN OUR BOX FOR DOOMBUM
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT LET'S STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE IS A CLASS IN STINGED TO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS DO I WANDERED UP THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT DRAWS TO STAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RED AND DO AT A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FOR THE BATH PROCESS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE JOYOUS TROUBLE AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRAINEER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESERVE AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO LANQUISHIOUS OPPOSITION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAAFFNEY AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUNDER FOR VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE JIMMITOR MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILES HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS A DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISE IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEAR ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF PRE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMARTIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN SIDE WHICH AFIA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATION OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT IS BLINDNESS TO GUARD HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMAN TO WHOM NO TIBAND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 TRADES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HEROD KNIGHTCO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENO'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL GAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LASSMAICUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMAN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEGIOUS AND TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ODDS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HEPOS AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AIMIAN TESTS THE LEG CHRYCIPUS IN THE ADMIRABLE PROGRESS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVEED CLOVER THE LOOK PROMISING FULL LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISE WORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ALSO KNOW IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORLD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SEND YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED WORN
5484-24317-0024 HE WIN AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENAU HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN ROADS
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALL THEIA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HER MIND LISTENED TO THE APPARENT SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENAL ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CADISTURE OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATES HER MIND'S FELLOW STUDENT ASK THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HISIMATOR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES ASSISTED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMAND SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ELDEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HARMON'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREATING AUGUST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOSE SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION AND SNAOWS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT GREY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIPS
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HARMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS ROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISONER THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S STOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LOVE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SAID AN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT DESPAIR HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT WAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HUMMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS VIRTUES AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS A FINEING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMSIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET IT WAS NO ALLUSIONS THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIER
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING THEM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 BLASI WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONER'S AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMAND IN GENERAL PHILIPUS HER FATHER'S GUESSED WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HARIMON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOW THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAIL TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO BE WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAAFFN AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIP WAS SILENCED HARD WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH A WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH IN COHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURNED THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MANTLE DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHTING GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PULSE OF THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU OTHERWISE
5484-24318-0021 DAFTNEY EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IT NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HARMAN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORE I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAF YOU RAISED YOUR FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE TOMETER IS THE WORK OF MERTOES
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE OR OF DEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AN I FOOL BLINDED ALL TORN MINE COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PAY YOU TO NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SOERCHIES INTENDED TO LEAP THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALES AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY IN HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINAS THE RADIAN CHRYCIPUS AND PROCLAS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE NEXT WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROGGED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM PROCEEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS PEERING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FEASTILE PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS CORCING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDEDRED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HAREMON
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATILLOUS AND JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERE ON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATION OF THE DEMEETOUR HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOR TO MORTALS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THE NOBLE FEAST TILL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR A COVERY
