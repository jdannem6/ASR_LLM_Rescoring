4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT IN THE LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING A PRIDE AND COMMENCED THE EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S NOISE BOOMED BUT US BY

4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIST CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHT BEFORE REACHED THE FIGURE AT A NEGRO BOY

5442-41168-0004 WE SHED ALL BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH BUT NO SHAKING THE ACONS OF THE MARTIAN HE'S NOT A GASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 WHAT'S PLEASE BE REASON
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLICABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS A MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DISPOSITION ABOVE FLARE OFF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SIRG EVEN OF IT EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET IT OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET IT IN THE MARTIAN IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARILY TO SECURE VIRAT'S LIKE TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLAROZIGHT TO VOTE THEY WAS DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM GATHER EXPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS ADDED THE FRESHMEN BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GLEE WAS GOOD RAIDER WHO SHORTEST GONE FOR THE OTHER YOUNG WAS AND WAS JOINED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP MAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LIVING ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE DONE TO SURGEON EVEN IMAGE WITH THE QUESTION WE'RE MOREY TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SO SHE EVEN APPROACHED GROUND
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A METAPHOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE TRUSTED IT THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL A MOREOVER COME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY TO CHEAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SAKE FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 SANG ON THE WISE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER ARM
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH OF BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WHERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEM SENSE CONQUERED
5442-41168-0021 IN THE BLASTON HAD GOTH SPOKE OF THE TRUST AND NOBLEMAN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLEASED IN HIM THE OFFETUM THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DISSOLVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOVILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHALL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO ELEVEN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SELL
5442-41168-0024 AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEAR THROUGH A SIDE DOOR

5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTEABLE FLOW OFF TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMAN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED THE MEANING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT ASSOCIATE EVENOVITCH STEPPED ON ARGUVAGE STIRSKY AND THE REST VICKUS RONSKI IN AN INQUIRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TOWARD WAS BEING SET AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0002 HE'S SUCH A BLACK GUARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ALL THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A POLICE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEAD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FINE CHAMPEY

5442-41169-0008 WHY WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE IS NO MEANS IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN DO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONVICTIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF ASSAULT
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO DELTITUDE DOES ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF THE SOUGHT BUT WE ARE THE LAND ONERS
5442-41169-0014 THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTABLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LEAN OUT TO GARDEN CLIMBING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNEW AND THEY YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD THE CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNAWED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T COME DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT TWO BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SHE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAMB DOING
5442-41169-0017 BUT ONE'S WALK IS SHOWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WHEN ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND ONCE MORE THE LANDONNA WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS IN THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO DAYS FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES N'T
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOVE THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEP UPON MISS LIVECH EVER THINGS WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT TO YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'VE GOT DOWN THE LANTERN
5442-41169-0023 HERE ARE YOU THOUSANDS OF LINES AND EACH WOULD MAKE DO OF GOOD BARRELS A BACH
5442-41169-0024 YOUR MERIT IHOOD SAID THE LANDOLA
5442-41169-0025 YES EXALD A STRANGER WHO WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LANDLE HAD CHUCKLED UP IN HIS WHITE CANSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN OUR BOX FOR DOOM THEM
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO HER THOUGHT THAT IT'S STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE IS A CLASS INSTINCT TO OF WHAT ONE ART AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS DO I WANDERED UP THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT DRY STAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A BEGUN TO ADD A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FOR THE BATH RECKLESS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HEERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE JOYOUS TROUBLE AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUFRAINEER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAL HERSELF AT DESERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO LANQUISHOUS OPPOSITION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNEY AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT EARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE JIMMETOUR MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTTILAS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS A DOUBT WHICH HAD ARRIVED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT ABRUPTLY TO THE NEIGHBORING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMARTIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN SIDE WHICH AFY HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATION OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS TO BEARED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMAN TO WHOM NO TAP ON HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CREATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HEROD KNIGHTO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENO'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAM'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LUSSMAICUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HERMAN INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMAN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND ILLEGIOUS AND TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTICE ODDS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HEPAS AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES I HEAR AMMY TESTS THE LEG CHRYCIPUS IN THE ADMIRABLE PROGRESS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVEED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISE WORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED OFF TO KNOW IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WAY CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SET THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED BARON
5484-24317-0024 HE WAITED HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENAU HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN ROADS
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND AL THEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMANN LISTENED TO THE PARENTS SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENAL ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CADISTURE OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATES HER AUNT'S FELLOW STUDENT ASK THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HISIMATOR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES SEIZED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HER MIND'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CREATING HONEST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ALL YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION AND SMELLS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUABLE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HARMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISONY OF THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLACK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DUE TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SET AN END AS A BOOM FROM THE MORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREATER AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FAINT
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HARMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS PERILS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS A FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT LEMISS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET I WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST TASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING RETREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 BLASLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMAND IN GENERAL PHILIPUS HER FATHER'S GUESSED WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HARON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOW THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAIL TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAAFFNING AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIP WAS SILENCED TOWARD WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH IN COHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURNED THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MANAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHTING GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTIST IN THE POSSESSION OF THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALL ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 TAPMMY EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IT NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HARMON WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN AFTER YOU RAISED YOUR FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE TOMETER IS THE WORK OF MERTOES
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE OR ADEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AN AH FOOL BLINDED ALSO MINE COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE WILL YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PAY IT NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SOAR CRIES INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALUS AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY IN HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINAS THE RADIAN CHRYCIPUS AND PROCLAS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LOST WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN AFTERNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM WAS SEATED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH IT WAS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FEASTILE PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS CORCING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWNED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GUARD LANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HAREMON
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATEULOUS AND JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERE ON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMEATOR HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOR TO MORTALS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THE NOBLE FEAST AT ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR A COVERY
5764-299665-0000 OFF TO IT IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN THENCE AND LOVES AND AT THE EXCHANGE FOR OR IN ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THESE GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST

5764-299665-0020 TO REPROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE AIR AND SWALLOWED TWO THOUSAND OFF HIS HEAD WITH CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOS HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WEAK RIVERS A FIRE
