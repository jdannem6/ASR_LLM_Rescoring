3528-168669-0130 I SHALL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFCTIONARY ICES AND DESERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF OBSERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 THREE GATHERED IN WHAT A FOLLY OTHER WILL SOON BE BUILDED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY CALLS BY A GREAT ATTENTION UNCONSIDEABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIPS THE FINGER INTO THE SERP AND APPLY TO THE THUMB THE TENACI OF THE SERVE WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTEN BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP AND ASPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO BRUISE OF MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE WAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CAME
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN NOR NINE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE THEY SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE RECENT EFFORT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING CAN INTO AN EARTH AND PAN IS THAT THE ACCENT OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FORCE BY SERVE WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOW OR UP AND ON A SEED AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH PATTERN CHILDREN BEING SHIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY RETURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LIMITSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARVELADES GEMS AND FREE PACES OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARLIES AND JAMES DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LANGUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RHINES WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SWEARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAY IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIP UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 PERFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONVICTIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBSRS AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOY WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMES WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATINWARD COMPOSE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFERARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY COUSINE
3538-142836-0020 A THOUSAND AND WORN ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASE FROM THE INSPECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGEES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERVES
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR ASHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 RACES
3538-142836-0024 AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES EYES AS ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE BATTLE IS GENTLELY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THESE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO EVOKE IN DISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE TILL THE TIME A WIDOWOR WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PIECE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO HER HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FAIRED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GROW SAID ADD
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HATE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF END
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHERS SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 AH WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEAN HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SENDING STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNLAPPED
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND IN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BARRED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTFUL THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WELT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVENFOLDS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORD TO WASH THE FOOLS AND THAT HE COULD DO WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU LODGE FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT IHOW SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEE A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THAT THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PUBLISHED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE POOLS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE MISCHIEF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME ANSWER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME CALL YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE HOLES WERE WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLIFF OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HOG
3538-163622-0009 SO THEY HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HIS LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY CEDAR LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE WHEN CINDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH TO A PLACE SAID CINDA LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDER LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONGWAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY'D GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAIN EARTH JUST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT HIS WHITE SAID CINDALOD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKED LIKE THE CHUNK OF THE GREAT THICK BARCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SILVER LAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DROP FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO LAY THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHO NOW ARE TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROUBLE WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAVE IT A LONG LONG WAY THE FOWL SAID GUST A SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE QUEEN SEES THERE NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOOL DOES THY NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS THE RIVER SAID THE HOLE AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SENORAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTHWARD WHEN MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND THOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROOK AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT YIELD
3538-163624-0003 SO ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE A ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOURS BRAVE IS YOUR FATHER HE WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED AUDNER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DOOR BORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REAN MADE A SWORD AND SUGAR TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON ALL UP THE IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN CIGARETTE WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND AS FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REKEN
3538-163624-0010 SO SILVER SAID THAT SORT WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED LONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SYRIA WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 CONVICT SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALLMEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LET DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FLAFFER AND THEN STAFNER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN TRIGGER GREW BACK AND MET REGAN AND RIGGING ASKED HIM TO ROSTOV AFTERER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO CIGARETTE PUT THE HEART OF FAT NOR ON A STICK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THEIR CIGARETTE ROSTING FASTER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HIM FELT TO THE PLACE WHERE BURN HILLED SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING WHO RISE UP AND RISE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE THOU FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEP HER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN CIGARETTE RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF THE KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 WHEN BURN ILL FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUTTER SHUT HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BURN HELD IN GUNDRA AND WERE BATHING BURN HAD WAITED FARTHER OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDERING SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FRAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOULT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD

3764-168671-0016 JEROVAJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
