3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE THEM MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFESSIONARY ICES AND DESERT ASHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESSES VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WHAT A FOLLY OTHER WILL SOON BE BUILDED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY CARS BY A GREAT ATTENTION ANDCONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIPS A FINGER INTO THE SERP AND APPLY TO THE THUMB THE TENACI OF THE SERVE WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTEN BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUME THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SPOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN ASPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO THOSE OF MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE IS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CAME
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN OLD NINE
3538-142836-0009 BORE THEM UP THROUGH THEY SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE THAT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE RECENT EFFORT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING CAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ASPECT OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FIRST BY SURP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOW OR UP AND ON A SEED AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED CHILDREN BEING SEATED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEIR TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THE ORANGE AND LINENSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARVELADES GEMS AND FRUIT PACES OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW AND VERY GENERAL QUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARLIES AND JAMES DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RHYMES WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN OH THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERV MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAIN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ALL THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBUTE UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 DEFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFESSIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBSRS AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOY WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMES WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATINWARD COMPOSE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM COMPLEXIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUEEN
3538-142836-0020 A THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT HAD DRAWN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD WE PURCHASE FROM THE INSPECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE RAIN OF OUR TWO LAST JUDGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES AND STEMS
3538-142836-0023 ICEIS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY DID BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE BATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BREAD AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THESE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE IN DISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE TILL THE TIME A WIDOWER HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO HER HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FEARED WORSE OR WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GO SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SOUGHT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THESE PROMISE TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH THROUGH THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SPITE OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE CITY
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAME ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LUD HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BENGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SENDING STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH A COLD SNAKE UNPAIDED AND UNLAPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND CAN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BOWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN THEY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GIVE A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FALLS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH SAW THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORD TO WASH THE FALLS AND THAT HE COULD DO WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRISONS IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HAD SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEE THE PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 BUT THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PUBLISHED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE HOLES FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE STIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME AND THERE COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME CALL YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LIKE THE HOLES WERE MORE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLIFF OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON THE LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SEPAR LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLOD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SIR TO A PLACE SAID CINDA LADD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUST RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDA LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED DOWNWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAIN YEARS JUST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID CINDA LAD
3538-163622-0017 IT WAS LIKE THE CHUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SYLVIA HAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DROP FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS AND THE PRINCESS WHO NOW ARE TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE'S A MIGHTY TRIAL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAVE IT A LONG LONG WAY THE WOLF SAID GUST A SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE CORPORAL SEE SOME NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FALL DOES THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOLD AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SLIM LAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTHWOOD ONE MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOOT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAVE AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE YIELDED
3538-163624-0003 SO ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE WOMAN THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOURS BRAVELY YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED AUDOUR WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DUKE WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REKIN MADE A SWORD AND SUGAR TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON ALL UP THE IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN CIGARETTE WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND AS FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REKIN
3538-163624-0010 SO SAILOR SAID THAT SORT WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO THE CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED LONG AND LEFT IN DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGNATURE WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 CIGARETTES SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN THAT DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOUFFENER AND THEN STAFFER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN CIGARETTE GREW BACK AND MET REGAN AND RIGGING ASKED HIM TO ROSTOV AFTERER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO CIGARETTE PUT THE HEART OF FAT NOR A MISTAKE AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE CIGARETTE ROASTING FASTENER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HIM FELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BURN HILLD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING WHO RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMED OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SYRIA RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 WHEN BURNHAM'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUTTER SHUT HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BURN HELD IN GUNDRON WERE BATHING BURN HAD WAITED FARTHER SOUTH INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDERANT SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD READDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BETTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS AND OFFICERS
367-130732-0001 WHEN AS THE SLOPES DO NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMEER OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME THIS SENTENCES OF FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT HAS CALLED A LOBSTER AND FRANCISCO IS NOT A ABSURD ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH ARE ANSWERS EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT TO DELICATE FLAMOR AS OUT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIA WAS STRENULOUSLY INSISTS AND IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIA
367-130732-0004 A BOOK SHOULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THAT ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCTED BY SHEFTS OF WARD BY FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER AND LYNDE NEWBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE REST BE THOUGH A FOLLOW WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMONICO

367-130732-0013 GOBYS PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SCR AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBIES OF BEFORE THE FAR BUT HIS PROCEEDS DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GOBIES CROWDS DO
