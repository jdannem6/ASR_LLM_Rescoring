8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAIL CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MURDER PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DEATH WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A LAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
