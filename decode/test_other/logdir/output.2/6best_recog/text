3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAKE IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN HONEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANYONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT I IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HUTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE IT ALL FOR SO SAYS OF JUSTINIAN'S VAPOURSHING THE NEIGHBORS ANDAYED IT THAN THAT BY THE NEIGHBORS THE NEIGHBORS AND HAPPY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE WITH ALL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASE NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN IT ON ANY OCCASION WHATSO EFFORT YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE HE KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 YET I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU HE SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE SOMEBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER

3080-5040-0003 I WONDERED HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHAT TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE EXHIBIT THEMSELVES

3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAILED BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET AN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PAINT IN WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTICISM ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET HIGH A VALUE UPON HER SISTER AND SHE DESERVES

3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LOSS PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGHED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKINDWOOD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSON
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SEE OUR PRAISE WHEN WE AT TIME
3080-5040-0027 WELL IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN

3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS A FINEST BOY THAT ERE YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWFUL HIS FATHER AT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU US WITH DISCOURSES OR A FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU HAD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOT FOR ANY OTHER KITCHEN ON MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MY THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OFF HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NOR OLD WOMAN WHO CAUSES FOR WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASANT TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS WITH THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASCART WITH NINE PEAS INCH UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PUT HER HEAD DOWN TURNED HIS GOOD BACK PUT HER FEET IN THE FANDER AND TOOK POT ON INTO HER LAP ORDER FIT ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SECOND
3331-159605-0001 THE MOCK PROPOS WAS THE MORE CREDIT
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OFF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DUST ASK ME AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT IS SPITEFUL THING I AM
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR LOT AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET MISS SEY HOW CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL A LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS PARTLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAYED HIM MORE THAN ONCE THE WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE BLESSED LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVE OF ROMANCE INTO HER LONG HOT WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHED MEN'S A POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDISQUIVABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL AND MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD BEEN A SPECIAL CHARM TO TARLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIGHT OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS PARTY AND IT FLOWED HOME MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HIDES A SOCIAL CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE A BEACH INTO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0014 PARTY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SIDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICA OF THE LOVE PICTURES THE ONLY KIND IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRUELY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLICE IN POSITION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A EYES PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPIES OF THE OLD EVEN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SET ITAKE CAME POLLY STUDD AT HIS ISSUE FOR A VISIT TO BACK HE AND FAST BUT COULDN'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE POSSIBLE FAN THAT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOCK BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TEN A HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO TO HER CHARITY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASTER CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMMY AND TALK PRETTY LIKE BILLY AND FLASSY SAID THE MATE
3331-159605-0019 AT THE STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC WARY WAS RELUCTANTLY SURROUNDING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO PONY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER TILL SHE HAD MET THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MEANT
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO LESSON TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS TO WAKE IT TO THE HORSES ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE TO FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRYS TO MEN TO FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISED YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU OH
3331-159605-0026 WHO LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE AWFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRIP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HAND THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS WAS OFF TO SETTLE THE MEADOW AT ONCE FOR PARTY'S SAKE AS BALLAS'S OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO AND YOU MADE A LAST PRAY IN REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING YOUR FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN AND BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME AND NIGHT
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUET IN HER AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND DREAMING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHT FORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITE LIKE LOVELY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMOUSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND EXCEPT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 TARLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAITH WITH WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FOR MANY THAT UNCLE HAD WHO LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 LOOKING TOO AND FOR US USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'D CHILLED HIM
3331-159605-0035 OUTILY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MANY SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PITCHON SO SHE COULD PEDDLE IN THE POTLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE A AFFECTED PARTY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS T
3331-159605-0039 TRULY DROUET FAN
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE BRIGHT BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND THEY HALF
3331-159605-0042 LET THIS GAVE HIM A HIND AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THAT THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN A MIND WOULD SITTING TEDLESS SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANDELMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT PARLEY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M HEART YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOWN WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEDED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST DIVIDE IN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERYONE WAS SOBUSY OF THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANS OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WHEN NOT BOTTLEED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE ALLER DID ITS ROCK AND WEND ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THAT THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THE ICE WITH THEM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SIDNEY OFTEN CALLED TERRIFICATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY REGARDED ALONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM RODE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THEY LET US HER SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NOW I AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRAVEL BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAME
3331-159609-0007 I TRIED NOT A DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEE US IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN FOR THIS
3331-159609-0009 QUITE POLLY IF THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 POOR PARTY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT AWOKE TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE BEEN NEEDED HOTEL HER FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE A HEAD IN THE SILVER CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTITCH AND THE HANDERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FERTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS AS TOO BIT OF ME NOT A GUESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TEN EARNEST AND DEFINED THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVE AND ADMIRATION OF PAUL'S LIARTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ARD ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW RELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE FELLOWS WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MAN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY'S ONLY THING SIR SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HOPE FOR ARE AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST ANDREA AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO PAY THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER WHEN THE LAST ABOVE THE GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SITNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THE CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME IN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTED TO SIT DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SOON ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT BRENDA AND THOSE NEWS TO HER SAW AND VONDA EDWARD MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NIGHT WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN AT A DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME WALKING IN THE POND HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE PUT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HAD HE KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY AGREED
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SIGHT BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAGEN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSIEUR SAINT FOURSCOIS GAVE IT TO MY SIGNOR SAGERIAN MONSIEUR SAINT TRULY GAVE IT TO MONSIEUR SAINT YOUUSSIBIUS MONSIEUR SAINT YOU SEE THIS GAVE IT TO MONSIEUR SAINT PERCOPIOUS ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOL GIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE FOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH BROKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FONTRAVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THE SUBJECT SO ANYONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMON FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE ON OCCUPIED OR BORN IN THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHOCOLATE SYMPATHETIC RELIIC

3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS SITTING PERHAPS THAN OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EVER TO BUY BUT THE DANCERS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE CALLIC
