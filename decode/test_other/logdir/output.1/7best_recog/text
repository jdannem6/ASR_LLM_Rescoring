1688-142285-0000 THAT'S I AND THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STILL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MY GOOD SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WOULD MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHARP BOY

1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKE BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO ARE ALWAYS ACUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUIET RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HAS FOLLOWED DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORLDHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BARE THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN WATER PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME AFFORDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST MY FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISS THORNTON IS NOT ONE BY FANCY TO WAIT TILL TIDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT MARTIN

1688-142285-0016 O PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDET OF WOLF
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL PALACE HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM EARLIE AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MAN AROUND HIM THOUGH A POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS AS OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT F VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPERFECTENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HIM MOTHERS WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEANING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER IT CAME

1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBERS SOON OFF TO DIXON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE COULD A FEW WOODS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAY FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FORMED WOODS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH REFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADEN HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE WOULD THEY BUILT A LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANTS GIVE DIXON PERMANENT SEASONS SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIMES OF THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
