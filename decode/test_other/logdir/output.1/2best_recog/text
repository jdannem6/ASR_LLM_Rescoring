1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS A THING ALL LIKE BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHARPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 IS FOLLOWED DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORK HOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BE THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHUNK FROM THE DISCLOSES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MOTOR PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME TOWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST MY FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISS THORNTON IS NOT ONE MY FANCY TO WAIT TILL TIDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT

1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM EARLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MAN AROUND HIM THOUGH A POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS AS OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS EYE IN NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT FCIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT

1688-142285-0021 MARGUERITE WAS COLLECTING HIM MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER AT IT CAME
