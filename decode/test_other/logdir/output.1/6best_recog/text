1688-142285-0000 THERE'S I AND THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STILL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MY GOOD SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUESTS DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHUT BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MAIN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKE THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF WRETCHED THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS A THING OR LIKE BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHARPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISS THE HELE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED ALL WAS AT SOME POT OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FOLLOWED DING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WALK HOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER WAS SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHUNK FROM THE DISCLOSES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MORTAL PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORCES TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST MY FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISS THORNTON IS NOT WANT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TIDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT LONDON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED HONEST A FATHER
1688-142285-0016 O PAPA BY THAT TASTEING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM EARLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE IN MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THOUGH A POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS AS OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS EYE ON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT FICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROFIDNT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGUERITE WAS COLLECTING HIM MOTHER'S WALKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE A FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER THAT IT CAME
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISTER WHARTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PESS ME I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL

1688-142285-0028 BUT GOOD KNIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN A BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS A CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF A MISTRESS COLD UP ON MY SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBERS SOON AFTER DIXON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STALL OUT SHE COULD A FEW WOODS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAY FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENJOY SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FORMER WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADEN HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE WOULD THEY MEET TO LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANTS GAVE DIXON PERMANENT CITIZENS SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIMES OF THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BUSY HEARKINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL BUSY HOW I DO

1688-142285-0041 MARGUERITE TONED ROUND TO WALK HOMESIDE OF THE GO IN A FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWOOD
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR A MINOROT TO SHE DID NOT SPEAK

1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS EASY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 CHAP US IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONG AND SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALLED STREET BUT HE SAID
