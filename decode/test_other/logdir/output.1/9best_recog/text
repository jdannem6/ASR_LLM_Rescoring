1688-142285-0000 THEY'S ON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STILL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MY GOOD SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOT BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DONN'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF RICHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHARP BOY WAS A THING I LIKE BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACHIUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISS THE HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN REDUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME POTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 IS FOLLOWED DING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WAY HOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT SPARE THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHUNK FROM THE DISCLOSES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN WATER PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARD TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST MY FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TADDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT MEETING
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED HOSTA FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OPAPAUGH BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL CAUSE HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM EARLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THOUGH A POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS AFTER THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS EYE IN NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT FARCIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROFITNT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HIM OTHER'S WALKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUTH MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT IT BECAME
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PASS ME I DIDN'T LIKE HIM AT ALL

1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBERS SOON OFF TO DIXON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE COULD A FEW WOODS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAY FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENJOY SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FROM WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH REFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADEN HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE COULD THEY MEET A LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANTS GAVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIMES OF THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
