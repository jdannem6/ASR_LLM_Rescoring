1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL PAUSE HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM EARLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE IN MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MAN AROUND HIM THOUGH A POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS AS OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS EYE ON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICUOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
