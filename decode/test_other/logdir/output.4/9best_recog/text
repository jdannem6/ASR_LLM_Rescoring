4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS THAT UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE COLD OF ASHER BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED

4198-61336-0030 THE KINGER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITAL SHAPEDIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVISHED AND DESPOILT
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I INTERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THE BEST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SAID AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME

4294-14317-0010 GEORGO CAME FOR THEM HIS HEALTH
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BYRNA DOONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND MONTONI LANDEY WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO BABYLON

4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN PART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WHILE DUR WAS RATHER SURELY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MIS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDILLON AND WRETCHES PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SET DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE SISTERED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLED IN LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNACASISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND LEARNED WHO WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND THE STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LEFT HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTE
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BE ONE BEFITTING THEM MADE IN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL THE WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING GESTURE BEGAN SHAKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF EPHLOREIDE HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE GESTURE AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR TO HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST FRIEND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL PRAIRIE WITH FILMY WINGS BUT SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS A THUNDER TIS THE EAGER CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US WHEN YOKEERS MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CASTLE AND NASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS PEA COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL THOUGHT WHEN I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE TO STRAY THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLIES TO MEET HIM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALLS SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LIMPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN THE VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S PACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE DO TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BE BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL IN RIGHT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH VAGATES THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AGE ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR A LORD HOMELESS WANDERER HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL AND SOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHT AWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OVER
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ECHOREY'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT IF THE READ HE DID NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVED THE PRINCE PRINCE HIS OH
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM THE JOY OF THE BRUTE ONLY ARRIVED LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED THE FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECTED ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO THAT LACK SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE NIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF FLIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINU TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ARRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTLED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS GUIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON APPLEED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST HER EFFORT TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID TURFRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A ESCORT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT WILL BE ENOUGH OF
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WAY YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 YOU KNOW GERMAN NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAIN WORK BUT ONE CAN MOVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES STILLER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCH BANKERS
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE WATCH CAR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HELO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE LAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TENDER FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY VAST OR A HUNDRED SOU VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD AND SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH THE RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORK TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THIRTY FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPLE PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DESIRES AS SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE AT ASCENDING AS KAY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FIEND SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 HE IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LOOKS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT OF THE SIDE
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SALVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALATRICIAN NERVOUSING SADABILITY AND SO LONG
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION SAYS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TO BIRTH THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN AN TRADITION
4350-10919-0009 YES SAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THIS ALREADY PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE HOUSEKEEPER DONE IT OR SHALL HAVE THE DRIVERERON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED AWE IT IS
4350-10919-0012 THOUGH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW OUT IT TO HER RUN ASKED THE FAIR DAUGHTER
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING ELECTRICIAN ENOUGH A LOWERING
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED EXCITEDLY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING AT REMISCENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADD
4350-10919-0018 AH WILL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN CARS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 JOE TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING IF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM THAT HATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILED PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TOGETHER
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYE FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ASKED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE HAS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS SHOULD THE THIRD TIME YOU HAVE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE A FACE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS ERITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KATY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICLY EXPLAINED THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 BUT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WATHY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FATE IN FOREIGN QUAX AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GIVEN
4350-10919-0033 THEIR MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLED EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL WAR
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS OBSTINATELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE WAS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEAL MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLD BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASE IS IF AUTHORITY IS BODILY LINES
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF BLIND MODOLYVALANCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT GOSSIPS OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL YOU IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER OF SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT COULD NOT BE WISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS CAN THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SAYS THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SINKS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASES ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AND AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENT OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTED
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRY BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROUP OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STAKE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES US OF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS TRASIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERN AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATIONS AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING OF THE FURTEST LINE BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH GOLDEN KNIGHTS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF US HAS BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAS ALWAYS BE
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE USE OF AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE HIS POSITION DEPOSITEDLY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE EPOCLASS KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FOR THREE THOUSAND WILL SOON BE IN SUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG ON PINCCOTANTS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE DRINK OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSIONS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGED SWIFTS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTED THE RECUTS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF COULDRIVY SPEECH PUT INTO PLAN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE A SLAVE'S TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS WAS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GIVEN THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS I SPLUTING THEIR SUCH AS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS AND SLAVE SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PRODUCT ITS BEAUTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOUR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONDAGES AS MONASCUE POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SORT OF DANGER FOR LABORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND HIS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE THE UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS HE IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN IMPRESSIONS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL WEALTHARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MANS RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORIOUS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL SOLITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTEDING STRIKE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PURSUIT OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIE SOCIAL LIKE VEIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT AND THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NOT ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THAT ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM AM I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A ESTATES TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED OF THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRMA AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STAINED VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL SPOUSE PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER KNOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE ESTATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY TWO CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE THE DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETYS ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENT'S NATIONS WILL BE INSLAYED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY HE IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATE WHO MIGHT HIS LABELS
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSAND THE PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTEMPTS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH A STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WHAT NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES THAT BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING COST THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY HE KNOW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CRIS LOOKED FROM UNDERAL PLATED FLASH LIKE TO A CARD JACK CAN SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO ONE NEEDS A JOB BAN THAT'S JAKIE HEI
4852-28311-0003 OTAY HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHAT CAN YOU ASK EM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIK BECAME UNEASY AND FISH AND MOASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FOOT OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EM STREET
4852-28311-0006 NO HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CRISIS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THEY HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 THINK YOU REALLY NEEDS IT AND PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW A TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CRISUDE INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 LIKE EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONE AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT IMPRESS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BITCHER N GO IT AFTER ALL MISS TURNED TO ON HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIGHT UNDERSTANDING ON THE QUARTER
4852-28311-0013 MOST SHOTS
4852-28311-0014 CRISTEL STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH COACHED ON THE HILL ABOUT MISTER WORKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE ALE SHAPE BRICK BUILDING IT SIR MISTER WICKERS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 NO LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK ON A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND HIS GUNS AND AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF ON THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS IN A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THERE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND LAY CLOUDS LOWER AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRISTADIATED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IT HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AND THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE ABOVE THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER OF THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAIN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME GRIST SAFE AT HOME IN BED AND SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABEL
4852-28311-0024 HE'D NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER BROOKER'S SHOP NOW HE'VE THOUGHT OF THAT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER FELL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHORN WELCOMED FROM THE DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES EITHER EXAMINED MISTER WORKER'S WINDOW AND POUR IT OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NEWIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GOT IN THE MISTER BROOKER'S SHOP
