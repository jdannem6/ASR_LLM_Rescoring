4970-29095-0007 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A BOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
4970-29095-0008 MOTHER I AM GOING TO STUDIED MEDICINE
4970-29095-0009 MARGARET BALTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY
4970-29095-0010 THE STUDIED MEDICINE
4970-29095-0011 DOES THEE THINK THEE COULD STAY AT SIX MONTHS
4970-29095-0012 AND BESIDES SUPPOSE THEE DOES LEARNED MEDICINE
4970-29095-0013 I WILL PURCHASE IT
4970-29095-0014 WERE THEE AND THY FAMILY ARE NO
4970-29095-0015 IF I COULD GET PATIENCE
4970-29095-0016 RUTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACE AND TIGHT AND FLUSHED IT WAS OUT NOW
4970-29095-0017 THE SIGHT SEEERS RETURNED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THE CITY
4970-29095-0018 RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIASM IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDING MOUSOLEUM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECHOING ROOMS AND NO COMFORTABLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ANYBODY
4970-29095-0019 AND THEN THERE WAS A BROAD STREET
4970-29095-0020 THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO INTO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIUM ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCHITECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST
4970-29095-0021 BUT NEITHER SAINT GERARD NOR BROAD STREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MEN NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING THE DECLARATION IMPRESSED THE VISITOR SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON EIGHTH STREET
4970-29095-0022 IS THEE GOING TO THE EARTHLY MEETING RUTH ASKED ONE OF THE GIRLS
4970-29095-0023 I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR REPLIED THAT MERE PERSON
4970-29095-0024 IT HAS OCCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND IN THE SHOPS THE EXACT SHADE FOR HER NEW BONNET
4970-29095-0025 AND THE WON'T GO WHY SHOULD I
4970-29095-0026 IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMAN TOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE CIRCLE OF LEAVES
4970-29095-0027 IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLEEK LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LIE IN THE CURBSTONE AND SHARE AT US AS WE COME OUT
4970-29095-0028 HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONT HERE AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A ONE SAY MEETING IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
4970-29095-0029 IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KICK UPOOS
4970-29095-0030 FATHER IS UNJUST TO PHILIP HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS
4970-29095-0031 HE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND HE KNOWS FARTHER THAT FORTUNES ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A NEW COUNTRY
4970-29095-0032 LET PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE ASKED TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY
4970-29095-0033 WHAT A BOX WOMAN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX VEILED AND PINIONED AND SHUT IN BY DISABILITIES
4970-29095-0034 WHY SHOULD I REST AND BE STUPID AND SET IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL
4970-29095-0035 AND IF I HAD A FORTUNE WOULD BE WANT ME TO LEAD A USELESS LIFE
4970-29095-0036 HAS THEE CONSULTED THY MOTHER ABOUT A CAREER I SUPPOSE IT IS THE CAREER OF THEE WANTS
4970-29095-0037 BUT THAT WISE AND PLEASANT WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
4970-29095-0038 RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT PHILIP HAD MADE A BUSH INTO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE AWAY FOR HIM
4992-23283-0000 BUT THE MORE FORGIVEFULNESS HAD THEN PREVAILED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THE FORCE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE
4992-23283-0001 MISS MILLER'S HALF IS NOT GOOD
4992-23283-0002 SAID MISSUS WADMAN A FEW MINUTES AFTER
4992-23283-0003 SO THERE IS TO ME ADDED SAMPERED WITH A SARCASTIC SNEER
4992-23283-0004 AND YET YOU MUST OWN HER BEHAVIOR HAS WANTED THEM HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE
4992-23283-0005 NO THAT I KNOW OF NOT ONE MORE THAT I KNOW OF HE REPLIED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT WHAT SHE HAD INSINUATED AND YET WITH A PERFECT ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE WRONG
4992-23283-0006 PERHAPS I AM MISTAKE IT ANSWERED SHE
4992-23283-0007 TO ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS OF YOU I BELIEVED WOULD BE UNFAIR
4992-23283-0008 HE SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HER REPLY BUT AS SHE MADE NINE HE PROCEEDED
4992-23283-0009 OH MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH A MOST FORCIBLE ACCENT YOU ARE THE LAST PERSONAL ON EARTH SHE WOULD PARDON ME FOR IN TRUSTING
4992-23283-0010 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MISS MILLOR'S ELECTION OF A HUSBAND SHALL NOT DIRECT MINE
4992-23283-0011 IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ESTIMATE HER OWN VIRTUE I DO
4992-23283-0012 IN INDEPENDENT OF HER FORTUNE SHE HAS BEAUTY TO CAPTIVATE THE HEART OF ANY MAN AND WITH ALL HER FOLLIES SHE HAS A FRANKNESS IN HER MANNER AN UNAFFECTED WISDOM IN HER THOUGHTS OF AVACITY IN HER CONVERSATION AND WITH ALL A SOFTNESS IN HER DEMEANOUR THAT MIGHT ALONE ENGAGE THE AFFECTIONS OF A MAN OF THE NICEST SENTIMENTS AND THE STRONGEST UNDERSTANDING
4992-23283-0013 MY LORD MISS MILLER'S TASTE DOES NOT A DEPRAVED ONE IT IS BUT TOO REFINED
4992-23283-0014 WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY THAT MISS WOODSLEY YOU TALK MYSTERIOUSLY
4992-23283-0015 IS SHE NOT AFRAID THAT I WILLTHWORT HER INCLINATIONS
4992-23283-0016 AGAIN HE SEARCHED HIS OWN THOUGHTS NOR INACTUALLY AS BEFORE
4992-23283-0017 MISS WOODLEY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE IT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS AND ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MITIGATED AGAINST THEIR UNION
4992-23283-0018 TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE ON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME
4992-23283-0019 I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I NOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD
4992-23283-0020 I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN ON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM TO THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG
4992-41797-0000 YES DID THESE FOUR YEARS AND A GOOD JOB FOR HER TOO
4992-41797-0001 WELL AS I SAY IT'S AN AWFUL QUEER WORLD THEY CLAP ALL THE BURGLARS AND DOWN THE MURDERERS AND THE WHITE BEATERS I ALWAYS THOUGHT A GENTLE REPROOF OF BE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FOR A WIFE PETER CAUSE HE PROBABLY HAS A LOT OF PROVOCATION THAT NOBODY KNOWS AND THE FIREBUGS CAN'T THINK OF THE RIGHT NAME SOMETHING LIKE SUNDAYARIES AND THE BRAKERS OF THE PIECE AND WHAT NOT AND YET THE LAW HAS NOTHING TO SAY TO A MAN LIKE HANDLORD
4992-41797-0002 GRANDFATHER WAS ALEXANDER CARRY L L L D DOCTOR OF LAWS THAT IS
4992-41797-0003 MISTER POPPHAM LAY DOWN HIS BRUSH
4992-41797-0004 I SWAYIN TO MEN HE EJACULATED IF YOU DON'T WORK HARD YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH THE TUBS DOCTOR OF LAWS
4992-41797-0005 DONE HE AIN'T DONE A THANK HE ORDER SINCE HE WAS BORN
4992-41797-0006 HE KEEPS THE THOU SHALT NOT COMMAND ITS FIRST RATE HAND LORD DOES
4992-41797-0007 HE GAVE UP HIS POSITION AND SHUT THE FAMILY UP IN THAT CHAMBER OF A HOUSE SO THAT HE COULD STUDY HIS BOOKS
4992-41797-0008 MISTER PAPA EXAGGERATED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY LEFT MUCH UNSETAD IN HIS NARRATIVE OF THE FAMILY AT THE HOUSE OF LORDS
4992-41797-0009 HENRY LORD WITH A DEGREE OF C H D TO HIS CREDIT HAD BEEN PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY AT A NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE BUT HAD RESIGNED HIS POST IN ORDER TO WRITE A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC TEXT BOOKS
4992-41797-0010 ALWAYS IRRITABLE COLD INDIFFERENT HE HAD GROWN RAPIDLY MORE SO AS EARS WENT ON
4992-41797-0011 WHATEVER APPEAL TO HER SENSE OF BEAUTY WAS TO GREAT WAY TRANSFERRED TO PAPER OR CANVAS
4992-41797-0012 SHE IS ROYAL TO KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS
4992-41797-0013 SHE MAKES EFFORT AFTER EFFORT TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS AND WHEN SHE FAILS TO REPRODUCE WHAT SHE SEES SHE WORKS HERSELF INTO A FRENSY OF GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT
4992-41797-0014 WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RAPID OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
4992-41797-0015 SO THERE MUST BE SOME BETTER WAY OF DOING I JUST DRAW THE OUTLINE OF AN ANIMAL AND THEN I PUT HAIRS OR FEATHERS ON IT THEY HAVE NO BODIES
4992-41797-0016 THEY COULDN'T RUN OR MOVE THEY'RE JUST PACEBOARD
4992-41797-0017 HE WOULDN'T SEARCH SAID DON'T WORRY REPLIED SEVERAL QUIETLY AND THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW THAT IT WAS SO
4992-41797-0018 THERE IN THE CEDAR HOLIDAY THEN LIVED ALL OF LORD AN ANGRY RESENTFUL LITTLE CREATURE WAY DOWN BY A FIERCE SENSE OF INJURY
4992-41797-0019 ALL OF MOURNFUL BLACK EYES MET NANCY'S SPARKLING BROWN ONES
4992-41797-0020 NANCY'S CURLY CHESTNUT CROP SHOWN IN THE SUN AND ALL OF THICK BLACK PLATES LOOKED BLACKER BY CONTRAST
4992-41797-0021 SHE IS WONDERFUL MORE WONDERFUL THAN EVERYBODY WE'VE EVER SEEN ANYWHERE AND SHE DRAWS BETTER THAN THE TEACHER IN CHARLES TOWN
4992-41797-0022 SHE'S OWNER THAN I AM BUT SO TINY AND SAD AND SHY THAT SHE SEEMS LIKE A CHILD
4992-41806-0000 NATTIE HARMON TRIED THE KITCHEN PUMP SECRETLY SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE EVENING FOR THE WATER HAD TO RUN UP HILL ALL THE WAY FROM THE WELL TO THE KITCHEN SINK AND HE BELIEVED THIS TO BE A CONTINUAL MIRACLE THAT MIGHT GIVE OUT AT ANY MOMENT
4992-41806-0001 TO NIGHT THERE WAS NO NEED OF EXTRA HEAT AND THERE WERE GREAT CEREMONIES TO BE OBSERVED IN LIGHTING THE FIRES ON THE HEARTH STANDS
4992-41806-0002 THEY BEGAN WITH THE ONE IN THE FAMILY SITTING ROOM COLONEL WHEELER WHILE THURSTON MISTER AND MISSUS BILL HARMON WITH NATTY AND RUFFUS MISTER AND MISSUS PAPA WITH DIGBY AND LOLEY JOY ALL STANDING IN ADMIRING GROUPS AND THRILLING WITH DELIGHT AT THE ORDER OF EVENTS
4992-41806-0003 CATHERINE WAVED THE TORCH TO AND FRO AS SHE RECITD SOME BEAUTIFUL LINES WRITTEN FOR SOME SUCH PURPOSE AS THAT WHICH CALLED THEM TOGETHER TO NIGHT
4992-41806-0004 BURN FIRE BURN FLICKERED FLICKER FLAME
4992-41806-0005 NEXT CAME OLLIVE'S TURNED TO HELP IN THE CEREMONIES
4992-41806-0006 WHILE THIRSTAN HAD FOUND A LINE OF LATIN FOR THEM IN HIS BELOVED HEARTS TO BE SPLENDID FOCUS FOR YOU THE HEARTH FIRESHINES
4992-41806-0007 OLIVER HAD PAINTED THE MOTTO ON A LONG NARROW PANEL OF CANVAS AND GIVING IT TO MISTER POPHAM STOOD BY THE FIRESIDE WHILE HE DECKLY FITTED IT INTO THE PLACE PREPARED FOR IT
4992-41806-0008 ALLAH HAS ANOTHER LOVELY GIFT FOR THE YELLOW HOUSE SAID MOTHER CARRY RISING AND TO CARRY OUT THE NEXT PART OF THE PROGRAM WE SHALL HAVE TO GO IN PROCESSION UPSTAIRS TO MY BEDROOM
4992-41806-0009 EXCLAIMED BILL HARMONY TO HIS WIFE AS THEY WENT THROUGH THE LIGHTED HALL
4992-41806-0010 AY'T THEY THE GREATEST
4992-41806-0011 MOTHER CARRY PORT COFFEE NANCY CHOCOLATE AND THE OTHER SELF SERVE THE SANDCHES AND CAKE DONNE AT SOME TARTS
4992-41806-0012 AT THAT MOMENT THE GENTLEMAN ENTERED BEARING A HUGE OBJECT CONCEALED BY PACE OF GREEN FELT
4992-41806-0013 APPROACHING THE DINING TABLE HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE ARTICLE IN THE CENTRE AND REMOVED THE CLOTH
4992-41806-0014 THINK SO TO MYSELF I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING ELSE PAPA GOOD MEN IF HE TOOK TIME ENOUGH AND BLEW ENOUGH SO I CARRIED THIS LITTLE FELLER HOW IN A BUSHEL BASKET ONE NIGHT LAST MONTH AND I'VE SPENT ELEVEN EVENINGS PUT IN HIM TOGETHER
4992-41806-0015 MISSUS HARMON THOUGHT HE SANG TOO MUCH AND TOLD HER HUSBAND PRIVATELY THAT IF HE WAS A COMING BIRD SHE SHOULD WANT TO KEEP A TABLE COVER OVER HIS HEAD MOST OF THE TIME BUT HE WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR WITH THE REST OF HIS AUDIENCE
4992-41806-0016 THE FACE OF THE MAHOGANY SHONE WITH DELIGHT AND WHY NOT WHEN IT WAS DOING EVERYTHING ALMOST EVERYTHING WITHIN THIS SCOPE OF A PIANO AND YET THE FAMILY HAD ENJOYED WEEKS OF GOOD NOURISHING MEALS ON WHAT HAD BEEN SAVED BY ITS EXERTIONS
4992-41806-0017 WE SHUT OUR EYES THE FLOWERS BLOOM ON WE MURMUR BUT THE CORONERS FELL WE CHOOSE THE SHADOW BUT THE SUN THAT CAST IT SHINES BEHIND US STILL
5105-28233-0000 LENGTH OF SERVICE THIRTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS
5105-28233-0001 HE SEEMED BLIND TO PLEASE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER HE POSSESSED
5105-28233-0002 IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTENDANTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
5105-28233-0003 WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVOURITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVE THE ACT BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
5105-28233-0004 ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LEADING A DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AND ENTRENCHMENT
5105-28233-0005 SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SURE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
5105-28233-0006 NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOOSS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONT MARCHRA
5105-28233-0007 BENZOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVANT AXE EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARE ON DISIMAL OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONARTRA WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
5105-28233-0008 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SURVODAC
5105-28233-0009 THE BOND OF UNION THUS AFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BENZOF'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONOURS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
5105-28233-0010 UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN CYCLOPEEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPER'S TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
5105-28240-0000 FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SIR THE DECK HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
5105-28240-0001 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONVICTION AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOP MASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
5105-28240-0002 EXCLAIMED SIR THE ACT KEEPING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT HIS TELESCOPE
5105-28240-0003 SHE IS UNDERSAIL BUT SHE IS COUNT T MICHEL'S YAT HE WAS RIGHT
5105-28240-0004 IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE VITALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS ARRIVAL
5105-28240-0005 HE RECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY ON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LATE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
5105-28240-0006 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRINA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
5105-28240-0007 SERVANT ACT TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DABRNA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
5105-28240-0008 A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE BRIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD INSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
5105-28240-0009 SLIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAIN SAIL AND IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMSMEN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOP SAILS BRIGANTINE AND JIB
5105-28240-0010 CAPTAIN SEVEREDACK HASTENED TOWARD HIM
5105-28240-0011 I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE OWNER OF FINDING YOU ON AN ISLAND
5105-28240-0012 NEVER MINE NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
5105-28240-0013 NOTHING MORE THAN YOU NO YOURSELF
5105-28240-0014 ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEMEDITERRANEAN
5105-28240-0015 FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPEFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THE COUNT WITH THE TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
5105-28240-0016 TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMIVE
5105-28240-0017 SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT OUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
5105-28240-0018 YOU WILL TAKE ME ONBOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT
5105-28240-0019 MY GOD IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD
5105-28240-0020 A COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD
5105-28240-0021 BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DOBRNA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOOD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
5105-28240-0022 IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOOLER WERE COMPLETED
5105-28240-0023 A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBET WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
5105-28240-0024 DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BENZUF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
5105-28241-0000 HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUMNAGION OF THE GLOBE
5105-28241-0001 AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YAHT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
5105-28241-0002 THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
5105-28241-0003 STEAM UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SCHOOONER STARTED EASTWARDS
5105-28241-0004 ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PURPLE SO BUOYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF OSCILLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
5105-28241-0005 FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALEXANDER BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
5105-28241-0006 THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SIXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
5105-28241-0007 THERE'S NO HERE OF THAT SIR
5105-28241-0008 IF THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ON TO THE SUN
5105-28241-0009 AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVANTAC EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
5105-28241-0010 OCEAN REIGNED SPRING
5105-28241-0011 ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE AUGYRIAN METROPOLIS
5105-28241-0012 IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITIES SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
5105-28241-0013 WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE INVISIBLE
5105-28241-0014 UNDER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
5105-28241-0015 TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FORTIF FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHEATRE
5105-28241-0016 YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF LUXURIA AS YOU IMAGINED
5105-28241-0017 AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER WAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
5105-28241-0018 ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARON OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
5105-28241-0019 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURNED IN DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARD THE NORTH
5142-33396-0000 AT ANOTHER TIME HAROLD ASK
5142-33396-0001 WHAT IS YOUR COUNTRY OLOF HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A THRALL THE GIRL'S EYES FLASHED
5142-33396-0002 TWO HUNDRED WARRIORS SEIZED IN HIS HALL AND FOLLOWED HIM TO BATTLE

5142-33396-0006 I MADE HER FINALLY TWENTY WARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT FEW MEN WOULD FOLLOW ME FOR I WAS YOUNG FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
5142-33396-0007 AT THE PROW I TARVED THE HEAD WITH OPEN MOUTH AND FORKED TONGUE THRUST OUT
5142-33396-0008 I PAINTED THE EYES READY FOR ANGER
5142-33396-0009 THEY STAND SO I SAID IN GLARE AND HISSED MY FOES
5142-33396-0010 IN THE STERN I CARV THE TAIL UP ALMOST AS HIGH AS THE HEAD
5142-33396-0011 THERE SHE SAT ON THE ROLLRS AS FAIR A SHIP AS I EVER SAW
5142-33396-0012 THEN I WILL GET ME A FARM AND WILL WIN HER IN THAT LAND NOW WHO WILL FOLLOW ME
5142-33396-0013 HERE'S BUT A BOY THE MAN SAID
5142-33396-0014 THIRTY MEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER RAISED THEIR CORNS AND SAID
5142-33396-0015 AS OUR BOAT FLASHED DOWN THE ROLLERS INTO THE WATER I MADE THE SONG AND SANG
5142-33396-0016 SO WE HADRIED THE COAST OF NORWAY
5142-33396-0017 WE ATEED MANY MEN'S TABLES UN INVITED
5142-33396-0018 A DRAGON'S BELLY IS NEVER FULL AND ON BOARD WENT THE GOLDEN
5142-33396-0019 OH IT IS BETTER TO LIVE ON A SEA AND THAT OTHER MEN RAISE YOUR CROPS AND COOK YOUR MEALS
5142-33396-0020 A HOUSE SNOWS A SMOKE OF SHIP SMELLS OF FROLIC
5142-33396-0021 UP AND DOWN THE WATER WE WENT TO GETT MUCH WEALTH AND MUCH FROLIC
5142-33396-0022 WHAT IS THE FARM OLAF NOT YET I ANSWERED WIKING IS BETTER FOR SUMMER
5142-33396-0023 HE WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A FEW SPARRKS ON THE HEARTH
5142-33396-0024 I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL FOR I WANTED NO SORT REACHING OUT OF THE DARK FOR ME
5142-33396-0025 COME HOME I CALLED WHEN NO ONE OBEYED A FIRE
5142-33396-0026 MY MEN LAUGHED YES A STINGY HOPES
5142-33396-0027 HE ACTS AS THOUGH WE HAS NOT EXPECTED US
5142-33396-0028 ON A BENCH OF A FAR CORNER WHERE A DOZEN PEOPLE HUDDLED TOGETHER

5142-36377-0000 IT WAS ONE OF THE MASTERLY AND CHARMING STORIES OF DEM AWE THE ELDER
5142-36377-0001 IN FIVE MINUTES I WAS IN A NEW WORLD IN MY MELANCHOLY ROOM WAS FULL OF THE LIVELIEST FRENCH COMPANY
5142-36377-0002 THE SOUND OF AN IMPERATIVE AND UNCOMPROMISING BELLE RECALLED ME IN DUE TIME TO THE REGIONS OF REALITY
5142-36377-0003 EMBROWS MET ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND SHOWED ME THE WAY TO THE SUPPER ROOM
5142-36377-0004 SHE SIGNED TO ME WITH A GOOSELY SOLEMNITY TO TAKE THE VACANT PLACE ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER
5142-36377-0005 THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS STILL STUDYING THE TWO BROTHERS WITHOUT I OBVIOUSLY CONFESSED BEING VERY FAVOURABLY IMPRESSED BY EITHER OF THEM
5142-36377-0006 A NEW NOVEMBER OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE WHO INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED THE ROOM
5142-36377-0007 A LITTLE CRAFT THAT IN THE POPULAR PHRASE WAS MY IMPRESSION OF THE STRANGER WHO NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SUPPER ROOM
5142-36377-0008 MISTER MEADOW ACROSS THE ELDER HAVING NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FAR HIMSELF INTRODUCED NEW COMER TO ME WITH A SIGH GLANCE AT HIS SONS WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE DEFIANCE IN IT A GLANCE WHICH AS I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DEFIANCE ON THEIR SIDE BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN
5142-36377-0009 VELVET FRANK THIS IS MY OVERLOOKER MISTER ALGO SAID THE OLD MAN FORMERLY PRESENTING US
5142-36377-0010 HE IS NOT WELL HE HAS COME OVER THE OCEAN FOR REST AND CHANGE HIS SCENE

5142-36377-0013 THEY POINTEDLY DREW BACK FROM JOHN JAWGO AS HE APPROACHED THE HIM TO CHAIR NEXT ME AND MOVED ROUND TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE
5142-36377-0014 A PRETTY GIRL AND SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY APPEARANCES A GOOD GIRL TOO DESCRIBING HER GENERALLY I MAY SAY THAT SHE HAD A SMALL HEAD WELL CARRIED AND WELL SETTLED ON HER SHOULDERS BRIGHT GRAY EYES THAT LOOKED AT YOU HONESTLY AND MEANT WHAT THEY LOOKED A TRIM SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE TOO SLIGHT FOR OUR ENGLISH NOTIONS OF BEAUTY A STRONG AMERICAN ACCENT AND A RARE THING IN AMERICA A PLEASANTLY TONE VOICE WHICH MADE THE ACCENT AGREEABLE TO ENGLISH YEARS
5142-36377-0015 OUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE IN NINE CASES OUT A TEN THE RIGHT IMPRESSIONS
5142-36377-0016 FOR ONCE IN WAY I PROVED A TRUE PROPHET
5142-36377-0017 THE ONLY CHEERFUL CONVERSATION WAS THE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE BETWEEN APRIL AND ME
5142-36377-0018 HE LOOKED UP AND NARROW UNDOUBTEDLY FROM HIS PLATE AND LOOKED DOWN AGAIN SLOWLY WITH A FROWN
5142-36377-0019 WHEN I ADDRESSED HIM HE ANSWERED CONSTRAINANTLY
5142-36377-0020 A MORE DREARY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SET OF THE TABLE WITH
5142-36377-0021 ENVY HATRED MALICE AND UNCHARITABLENESS ARE NEVER SO ESSENTIALLY DETESTABLE TO MY MIND AS WHEN THEY ARE ANIMATED BY THE SENSE OF PROPRIETY AND WORK UNDER THE SURFACE BUT FOR MY INTEREST TO MAY OWE ME AND MY OTHER INTEREST IN THE LITTLE LOVE LOOKS WHICH I NOW AND THEN SURPRISED PASSING BETWEEN HER AN AMBBROWS I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAT THROUGH THAT SUPPER
5142-36377-0022 I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MISTER MEADOW CRO'S INVALID CHAIR CUT HIM SHORTEN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WHEELED HIM OUT TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAVE
5142-36377-0023 YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT TO SAY NO EM ROSE BEGAN NEVER SMOKE WITH JOHNNY ALGO HIS CIGARS WILL POISON YOU
5142-36377-0024 THEY ONLY SHOOK A FOREFINGER REPROACHFULLY AT THEM AS IF THE TWO STURDY YOUNG FARMERS HAD BEEN TWO CHILDREN
5142-36377-0025 SILAS SLUNK AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST EMBRAS STOOD HIS GROUND EVIDENTLY BENT ON MAKING HIS PIECE AND NAIL ME BEFORE HE LEFT HER SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE WAY I WALKED ASIDE TOWARD A GLASS DOOR THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM
5142-36586-0000 IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECTS TO MUCH VARIABILITY
5142-36586-0001 SO IT WAS WITH THE LOWER ANIMALS
5142-36586-0002 THE VARIABILITY OF MULTIPLED PARTS
5142-36586-0003 BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DISCUSSED WHEN WE TREATMENT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
5142-36586-0004 EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUS OF PARTS
5142-36600-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN ON THE RACE IS OF MAN
5142-36600-0001 IN DETERMINING WHETHER TWO OR MORE ALLIED FORMS OUGHT TO BE RANK TO SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS SO PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEY ARE OF PHYSOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE BUT MORE ESPECIALLY WHETHER THEY ARE CONSTANT
5639-40744-0000 ELEVEN O'CLOCK HAD STRUCK IT WAS A FINE CLEAR NIGHT THERE WERE THE ONLY PERSONS ON THE ROAD AND THEY SAUNTED LEISURELY ALONG TO AVOID PAYING THE PRICE OF FATIGUE FOR THE RECREATION PROVIDED FOR THE TO LEADANS IN THE VALLEY OR ON THE BANKS OF THEIR RIVER
5639-40744-0001 SECURE AS HE THOUGHT AND THE CAREFUL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THAT CITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WELL DISPOSED INHABITANTS THE GOOD AT ALGO WAS FAR FROM THINKING THAT ANY DISASTER COULD BEFALL HIS FAMILY
5639-40744-0002 RODE ALSO AND HIS COMPANIONS WHERE THEIR FACES MUFFLED IN THEIR CLOAKS STARED BRUTALLY AND INSOLENTLY AT THE MOTHER THE DAUGHTER AND THE SERVANT MADE
5639-40744-0003 IN A MOMENT HE COMMUNICATED HIS THOUGHTS TO HIS COMPANIONS AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THEY RESOLVED TO TURN BACK AND CARRY HER OFF TO PLEASE REVIVAL FOR THE RICH WHO ARE OPEN HANDED ALWAYS FIND PARASISE READY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TO CONCEIVE THIS WICKED DESIGN TO COMMUNICATE IT APPROVE IT RESOLVED ON RAVISH ONLY OCADIA AND TO CARRY THAT DESIGN INTO EFFECT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT
5639-40744-0004 THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS HID THEIR FACES AND THE FLAPS OF THEIR CLOAKS TURNED BACK AND SOON CAME IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PARTY WHO HAD NOT YET DONE GIVING THANKS TO GOD FOR THEIR ESCAPE FROM THOSE ADATIOUS MEN
5639-40744-0005 FINALLY THE ONE PARTY WENT OFF EXULTING AND THE OTHER WAS LEFT IN DISSOLATION AND WOE
5639-40744-0006 REVOLVER ARRIVED AT HIS OWN HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT A LOUCADIUS PARENTS REACHED THEIRS HEART BROKEN AND DESPAIRING
5639-40744-0007 MEANWHILE LUDOPHO HAD LOCAIA SAFE IN HIS CUSTODY AND IN HIS OWN APARTMENT
5639-40744-0008 WHO TEACHES ME AM I IN BED
5639-40744-0009 FATHER DEAR FATHER DO YOU HEAR ME
5639-40744-0010 IT IS THE ONLY A MENDS I ASK OF YOU FOR THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE ME
5639-40744-0011 SHE FOUND THE DOOR BUT IT WAS BLOCKED OUTSIDE
5639-40744-0012 SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHTSHONE IN SO BRIGHTLY THAT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOR OF SOME DAMASK HANGING IN THE ROOM
5639-40744-0013 SHE SAW THAT THE BED WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE RATHER THAT OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN
5639-40744-0014 AMONG OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A CARPET NEAR THE WINDOW
5639-40744-0015 THIS PERSON WAS REDOUBTFUL THOUGH HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGED HIS MIND IN THAT RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT THEM BUT WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRL
5639-40744-0016 ON THE CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM THAT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY THE TEARS HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALF WAY TOWARDS HIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
5639-40744-0017 CHOKING WITH EMOTION OF LURCADIA MADE A SIGN TO HER PARENTS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM
5639-40744-0018 THAT WILL BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED HER FATHER IF YOUR PLAN WERE NOT LIABLE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY ORDINARY CUNNING BUT NO DOUBT THIS IMAGE HAD BEEN ALREADY MISSED BY HIS OWNER AND HE WILL HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT HE WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE PERSON HE LOCKED UP THERE
5639-40744-0019 WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO KEEP IT AND PRAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A WITNESS TO YOUR UNDOING IT WILL DEIGN TO REGULATE YOUR CAUSE BY ITS RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT
5639-40744-0020 THUS DID THE HUMANE AND RIGHT MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS
5639-40744-0021 SHE MEANWHILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PARENTS IN THE STRICTEST TO RETIREMENT NEVER LETTING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SHUNNING EVERY EYE LEST IT SHOULD READ HER MISFORTUNE IN HER FACE
5639-40744-0022 TIME ROLLED ON THE HOUR OF HER DELIVERY ARRIVED IT TOOK PLACE IN THE UTMOST SECRECY HER MOTHER TAKING UPON HER THE OFFICE OF MIDWAYTH AS SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVER SEEN
5639-40744-0023 WHEN THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS BLESSINGS WHERE SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BLESSING UPON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BORE HIM UPON THE FATHER THAT BEGOT HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP SO WELL
5639-40744-0024 ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASSED ALONG A STREET IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CONC COURSE OF HORSEMEN
5639-40744-0025 THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBER WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL IN THE SAME SPOT
5639-40744-0026 ALICE WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT IN A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DURING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD
5639-40744-0027 THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIX TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONNAH IS STEPHANIA WHO HAS A GENTLE WOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY IS A NATURAL AS CRUELTY AS TO MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL SHUTTING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THERE NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER NOCADIA FROM HER SWOON
5639-40744-0028 I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU SENOR SAID ANDREA TO FINDIA TO HER HUSBAND THE CREAM AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FAINTING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THE BOY AS YOUR GRANDSON
5639-40744-0029 THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM HER LIVES IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SON
5639-40744-0030 JUST THEN LAUCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN OUT OF BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END NEAR CADIUS WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESSED DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONS
5639-40744-0031 SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG HER ASSURANCES THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFLAMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES IN ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON THE STROLL WITH HER DOLEFUL THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ADUCTION OF A GIRL WHOM WERE DOLEFUL CARRIED OFF WHILST THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD
5639-40744-0032 FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVEN ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WILL DISCUSSED ME SO THAT WE MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH
5639-40744-0033 HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LAID HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANDLESTICKS
5639-40744-0034 ALL ROSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER AND TANCED WITH ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
5639-40744-0035 SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOREVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOR HER HEAD DROPPED AS SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYED STEPHANNIA
5639-40744-0036 HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DISTANT PROTECTOR BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
5639-40744-0037 NO THEN SON ON MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND A PORTRAIT WAS A PRETENCE
5639-40744-0038 JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATIONS WERE MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR THE ARCADIA GAVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS FOR THE HEARTS OF ALL
5639-40744-0039 WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF IN HER DOLEFUL'S ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGED HERSELF NO SENORA HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN HIS SOUL
5639-40744-0040 THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLAYS AT A TIME WHEN THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH I NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
5639-40744-0041 NOR WAS WERE DOFUL LESS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF SO WONDERFUL EFFECT HE BEGGED LOKCADIA TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS
5683-32865-0000 YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LEG
5683-32865-0001 SAID LORD SHELFORD ADDRESSING ME
5683-32865-0002 HE HAD HIS HAND ON LAKE'S SHOULDER
5683-32865-0003 THEY WERE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS
5683-32865-0004 WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRLANDAN RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
5683-32865-0005 BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN MEEK WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
5683-32865-0006 AT DINNER LENGTH WAS EASY AND AMUSING
5683-32865-0007 I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WILDER CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32865-0008 I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT DAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
5683-32865-0009 AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN TO THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT
5683-32865-0010 I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE TO THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
5683-32865-0011 WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE AC OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
5683-32865-0012 AND WILDER LEFT TWO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOR OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LAKE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DARKY ONLY REMARKING
5683-32865-0013 DO YOU KNOW LATE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
5683-32865-0014 HES NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
5683-32865-0015 I HAVE A HORROR DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
5683-32865-0016 OH I KNOW THAT'S LORD BRANDON
5683-32865-0017 ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LATE
5683-32866-0000 MISS LINCOLN DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
5683-32866-0001 AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTRY
5683-32866-0002 BUT WON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
5683-32866-0003 IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORM A NEW IDEA OF HER
5683-32866-0004 BY THIS TIME LORD SELFORD AND WILDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERALSHIP
5683-32866-0005 AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANCH AND HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32866-0006 YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAS BEEN WORSE
5683-32866-0007 IF A FELLOW IS BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE IS BEALS ABOVE AT ONCE
5683-32866-0008 BARTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
5683-32866-0009 I DON'T KNOW ONE CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FIND GENTLEMEN TO FIND WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
5683-32866-0010 WELL YOU KNOW READING WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRAGTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORCAS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
5683-32866-0011 THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PARTY NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID
5683-32866-0012 NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RAYDY FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING
5683-32866-0013 THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOUGHS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MOTTED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES
5683-32866-0014 DON'T INSULT ME STAND BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
