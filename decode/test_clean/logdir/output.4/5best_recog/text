3575-170457-0029 YOUR LETTER HAD GIVEN ME GREAT PLEASURE AND I SHOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DID NOT TELL YOU SO
3575-170457-0030 OF THIS SECOND LETTER ALSO SHE SPOKE AND TOLD ME THAT IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION FOR HER TO GO AND SEE THE POET IF EVER SHE VISITED THE LEAGUES
3575-170457-0031 ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SHE RATES
3575-170457-0032 COME CALM I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED OF YOUR ABSENCE
3575-170457-0033 SATURDAY AFTER SATURDAY COMES AROUND AND I CAN HAVE NO HOPE OF HEARING YOUR KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND THEN BEING TOLD THAT MISS YE IS COME OH DEAR
3575-170457-0034 IN THESE MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MIND THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
3575-170457-0035 I WISH YOU WOULD RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS TO THE ENSTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
3575-170457-0036 MY EYES FILLED TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WONDERING IN THOUGHT INDEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVONISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH
3575-170457-0037 IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR HER DIRECTION
3575-170457-0038 AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVA I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORRE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
3575-170457-0039 THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOMECIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELED THAT MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESORT
3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME AIR AND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK IN NO ONE SAW HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
3575-170457-0042 UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACCHURE COULD NOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT HER HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
3575-170457-0043 HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN YOURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT AND MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FERTILITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
3575-170457-0045 I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMIDATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY
3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BROAD DAYS A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGISH SHOP IN HALL WORTH FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTORS IN NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBYS FRACTURE LEG
3575-170457-0047 TABBBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANCE TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
3575-170457-0049 HIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
3575-170457-0050 TAPBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY IN AGE
3575-170457-0051 AT TEA TIME THERE WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0052 SHE HAD ANOTHER WAIT IN HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
3575-170457-0053 BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUFFER JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE RUSH OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0054 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRATED MISS W FOR HER FANCYED INDIFFERENCE TO ANNE STATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAY SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FINE ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0056 I DOUBT WHETHER BROWN WHALE WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH HE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT SEEING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEY PARTY AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
3729-6852-0003 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR BY PERNUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCOVERRA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCUURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERYONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
3729-6852-0005 SYLVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF NARIVO FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMMODIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO PROSERITY
3729-6852-0006 SYLVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HERSELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUME'D ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARRYING ANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MARAU AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONORABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SAVAIR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTIAN INTOLERCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTENDANT THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIA DIES
3729-6852-0010 I NEVER HAVE ANY FAMILY
3729-6852-0011 I HAD THE NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
3729-6852-0012 I SHALL CALL YOU ASPREY
3729-6852-0013 YOU DO ME A GREAT HONEST
3729-6852-0014 HERE GO AND DEAD ME CHANGE FOR A LOUIS I HAVE IT SIR
3729-6852-0015 AT YOUR SERVICE HERE
3729-6852-0016 MADAME QUINZON BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR INQUIRIES
3729-6852-0017 I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIGHER AT THE RIGHT OF ONE SOU MEN READING THE NEWSPAPER UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE OR IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE
3729-6852-0018 I SIT DOWN IN A SMALL TABLE A WAITER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO INQUIRE MY WISHES
3729-6852-0019 I TELL HER TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
3729-6852-0020 THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOKED LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0021 I THANK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVING
3729-6852-0022 I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WHITLLY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
3729-6852-0023 MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECTS MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
3729-6852-0024 I SEE THE CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
3729-6852-0025 IS THERE NOT A MARIDIAN EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0026 YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYALL IS THE MOST EXACT
3729-6852-0027 THAT IS TRUE BADELTHRY
3729-6852-0028 ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FAILED
3729-6852-0029 IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE SEVERE CAT
3729-6852-0030 IS IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
3729-6852-0031 BUT TOO HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE
3729-6852-0032 SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FAILED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
3729-6852-0033 YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS CERTAINLY A DAUGHTER OF WHICH THE WORLD HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR SIGHNESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT
3729-6852-0034 LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP AND LESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
3729-6852-0035 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
3729-6852-0036 WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT VVE LA ROY
3729-6852-0037 THEY INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
3729-6852-0038 WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM AND I FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
3729-6852-0039 HE HIMSELF RECITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
3729-6852-0040 FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT IT WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
3729-6852-0041 I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
3729-6852-0042 I AM VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIABLE AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
3729-6852-0043 I RESIDE IN THE MARSE THROUGH DE DUCE PORT
3729-6852-0044 I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU INSACIABLE
3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY ROBARTSTES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERY THING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTERDY SAINTS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SCENE HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUS OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY EPHOLIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TO DAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE HAVE A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY SNAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WORDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLIMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTED ORGANIZATIONS
4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PARCEL LIGHTS INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BILLING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HAS OBTAINED THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW IN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY FOR TRUTH
4077-13751-0006 THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SUM NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSILLATING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
4077-13751-0007 THE BUCAMOREMAN HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THEIR RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK A MORMAN STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF CURTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LIKE EERY AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERENT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES A MIZARY INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISYRIANS
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LITTLE BURNED WBOGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMAN HADER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTED SYMPATHY WITH THEIR PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICAL BY HUMAN SCRCRIBE
4077-13751-0014 MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN COLD WELL COUNTY THEREIN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHORE CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HABITLESS SETTLEERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOUR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS INTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNT ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0017 OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW OFTEN THE FACT
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBIGINSES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE FOUDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13751-0019 WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS IT THE MOREMANS
4077-13751-0020 AS THE SAMPLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MASYRIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MAZURI WITH GOVERNOR BOX AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS IN SIGHTED TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
4077-13754-0000 THE ARMY FOUND THE PEOPLE AND POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
4077-13754-0001 BUT A WORK FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOID'S ADVICE THAT YOUCATED ORDER THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SUCCESSIONISTS
4077-13754-0003 MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHERE GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
4077-13754-0004 ALREADY A NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST
4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY SAID POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD OF NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN IN ARMS FOR THEIR COUNTRIES NEED
4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LATTER DAY SAINTS CALL CELESTRAL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF CELESTAL MARRIAGE MORALITY OF WIFES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE IN A LITTLE RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATES SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED AND AUTHORIZ RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHEREIN WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE BLIND MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
4077-13754-0009 AT THE RECEPTION OF MORAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE
4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING MORAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SET AT PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT MORE MENDS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
4077-13754-0012 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOUR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT IN A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE I FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURTS POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTENDS SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FIND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THEY MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DURATION
4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONCITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
4077-13754-0015 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ISSUED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THAT PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL STATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON ITS FAINALI HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
4446-2271-0000 MAIN PAUL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0001 HE HAD FREQUENCY IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS
4446-2271-0002 IT'S TIMIDLY WELL PUT ON TOO
4446-2271-0003 IT'S BEEN AUNT ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
4446-2271-0004 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MEANWHILE LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANDSOME AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
4446-2271-0005 SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE SAT HER BEST ON THE SECOND BACK
4446-2271-0006 HE'S BEEN WANTED TO MARRY HELP OF THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
4446-2271-0007 SHE DOESN'T TAKEN UP WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW
4446-2271-0008 I REEMBER GOING ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
4446-2271-0009 MADE HOBUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
4446-2271-0010 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEY ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
4446-2271-0011 SIR HENRY TOWN MISTER PARKLY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0012 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT DIDN'T SHE
4446-2271-0013 YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS TO NIGHT BUT THE FIRST TIME
4446-2271-0014 WEST MERELY AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
4446-2271-0015 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NOSE POSSIBLY
4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
4446-2271-0017 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WIN AFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD OF THE THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
4446-2271-0018 SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THE I AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
4446-2271-0019 AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGIVE
4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY INSENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD THAN DAFT
4446-2271-0021 SHE MIGHT CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO
4446-2271-0022 I'M GLAD SHES HELD HER OWN SENSE
4446-2271-0023 AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY KNOWN

4446-2273-0000 HELD HER WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR

4446-2273-0005 I HADN'T HAD A CHANCE YET TO TELL YOU WHAT A JOLLY LITTLE PLACE I THINK THIS IS
4446-2273-0006 THEY ARE ALL SKETCHES MADE ABOUT THE VILLAGE DAY YOU SEE

4446-2273-0020 I THINK WE DID SHE ANSWERED HIM MERELY
4446-2273-0021 WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR RANK BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
4446-2273-0022 THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVER
4446-2273-0023 THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SILENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
4446-2273-0024 BARLEY STARTED WHEN HELD A RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHAT DID YOU DO THAT
4446-2273-0025 IT WAS VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED LOZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COFFEE

4446-2273-0027 WHEN SHE FINISHED ALEXANDER SHOOK HIMSELF OUT OF A REVERERY
4446-2273-0028 NONSENSE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SING EXCEPT THE WAY MY FATHER AND GRANDMOTHER DID BEFORE ME
4446-2273-0029 IT'S REALLY TOO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SEEING DON'T YOU FEEL IT
4446-2273-0030 ALEXANDER WENT OVER AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOUR HER
4446-2273-0031 HERE JUST IN FRONT
4446-2273-0032 HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MUSTY SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE
4446-2273-0033 FOR A LONG TIME NEITHER HILL NOR BARLEY SPOKE
4446-2273-0034 HE FELT A TRUMOR RUN THROUGH THE SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
4446-2273-0035 BARLEY LEANING OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TOUCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES
4446-2273-0036 ALEXANDER PLUNGED THE TWO HANDS AT HIS SIDES
4446-2275-0000 THE STOP AT QUEEN'S TOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERCY OR THINGS THAT HE NOTED DIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE
4446-2275-0001 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FOLLOWED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UP STAIRS
4446-2275-0002 ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTONING AND UN BUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HELD HIS LIVING ROOM
4446-2275-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN THEY ENTERED
4446-2275-0004 ALEXANDROV DID NOT SIT DOWN
4446-2275-0005 I FELL IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDID WAS GOING TO TURN UP
4446-2275-0006 I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SISTER KATE OR COUSIN MICK WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG
4446-2275-0007 SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER GAZE DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
4446-2275-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARLY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
4446-2275-0009 I GOT INTO ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
4446-2275-0010 ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE BLAZE
4446-2275-0011 PARTLY BENT LOWER OVER THE FIRE
4446-2275-0012 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CAT HOLD IN LEASH
4446-2275-0013 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TOO BARLEY SHE SAID TREMOLOUSLY
4446-2275-0014 I CAN'T STAND SAYING YOU MISERABLE

4446-2275-0017 BUT IT'S WORSE NOW IT'S UNBEARBLE
4446-2275-0018 I GUESS NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
4446-2275-0019 THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT SEEMS TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE
4446-2275-0020 IT WAS MYSELF I WAS DEFYING HILDA

4446-2275-0023 ALEXANDER GROUNDED I MEANT TO BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T

4446-2275-0026 SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRY IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS
4446-2275-0027 HE MOVED UNEASILY AND HIS CHAIR CREEKED
4446-2275-0028 YES YES SHE HURRIED PULLING HER HAND GENTLY AWAKE FROM HIM
4446-2275-0029 PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING BARTONLY AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY
4446-2275-0030 YES KILLED I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY

4446-2275-0033 WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I CAN NO MATTER HOW HARD I BEG
4446-2275-0034 KEEP AWAY IF YOU WISH WHAT HAVE I EVER FOLLOWED YOU
4446-2275-0035 ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF ANGRILY YES I KNOW A'M COWARDLY

4446-2275-0041 YOU SEE LOVING SOMEBODY AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
4446-2275-0042 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENT
4446-2275-0043 BARLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH THEN HER WET TIRED EYES
4446-2275-0044 A DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
4446-2275-0045 IF TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT
4507-16021-0000 CHAPTER ONE RELIGION
4507-16021-0001 IT ENGENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LAP PAG FOR WHICH RED THEFT AND A HOWL LAP A GRIN FOR WHICH RED HUNGER
4507-16021-0002 THUS IDLENESSS THE MOTHER
4507-16021-0003 SHE HAS A SON AFT AND A DAUGHTER HUNGER
4507-16021-0004 WHAT IS SANG
4507-16021-0005 WE HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE SORT OF OBJECTIONS
4507-16021-0006 SLANG IS ODIUM
4507-16021-0007 SLANG MAKES ONE SHUTHER
4507-16021-0008 HE DENIS THAT OF COURSE IT DOES
4507-16021-0009 WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WIND A GULF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
4507-16021-0010 WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH BEAUTY ACCEPTED AND FULFILLED MERITS
4507-16021-0011 WHY SHOULD ONE MIGHT EXPLORE EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0012 WHERE SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
4507-16021-0013 NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE FORMING OF SLANG
4507-16021-0014 NOW WHEN HAS HORROR EVER EXCLUDED DUTY
4507-16021-0015 SINCE ONE HAS MALEDY BANISHED MEDICINE
4507-16021-0016 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TURANULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS
4507-16021-0017 HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHOOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
4507-16021-0018 WHAT IS SLANG CLEVERLY SPEAKING
4507-16021-0019 IT IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF WRETCHEDNESS
4507-16021-0020 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHYAN ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLANG
4507-16021-0021 THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTARY WHO SAYS MY SKIP THE GUTTER THE HAIR DRESSER WHO SAYS MY MEALY BACK THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLING
4507-16021-0022 THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PROSUSES
4507-16021-0023 THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LOAF CLEARIFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BURNT THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALK SLING
4507-16021-0024 ALGEBRA MEDICINE BOTTONY HAVE EACH THEIR SLANG
4507-16021-0025 TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A LANGUAGE OF COMBAT WHICH IS SLUNG
4507-16021-0026 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MEN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVILIZATION IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO SEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
4507-16021-0027 PENICIAN VERY GOOD
4507-16021-0028 EVEN DIALECT LET IT THAT PASS
4507-16021-0029 TO THIS WE REPLY IN ONEWARD ONLY
4507-16021-0030 ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND DUTY
4507-16021-0031 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH THE VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH SOURCES PERMITTED
4507-16021-0032 HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WHERE CRAWL PELL MELL THOSE WHO BLEED IN THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO SUFFERS THOSE WHO INFLICTED IN THOSE WHO INFLICTED IN THOSE WHO INFLICTED
4507-16021-0033 DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MASTER WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
4507-16021-0034 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERASTE AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
4507-16021-0035 TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLEDLES IN EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0036 FACTORS FORM ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE OTHER
4507-16021-0037 THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASKS IN METAPHFUL RAGS
4507-16021-0038 IN THIS SKIES IT BECOMES HORRIBLE
4507-16021-0039 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN ANARTICULATE WORD
4507-16021-0040 ONE THINKS ONE HEARS HIGHDRESS TALKING
4507-16021-0041 IT IS ONINTELLIGIBLE IN THE DARK
4507-16021-0042 IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSE SLING
4507-16021-0043 THE EARTH IS NOT DEVOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A WAIL
4507-16021-0044 LOOK SLOWLY AT LIFE
4507-16021-0045 IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYTHING WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
4507-16021-0046 EACH DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT GREET FOR ITS LITTLE CARE
4507-16021-0047 YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBE OF A SLANDER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THAN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE IN YOUR CONSCIENCE OF PUBLIC COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE OF PUBLIC COLUMN
4507-16021-0048 THIS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO TO GHOST ON
4507-16021-0049 THERE IS HARDLY ONE DAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS HOLLY JOYOUS AND SUNNY
4507-16021-0050 AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL GLASS YOU ARE HAPPY
4507-16021-0051 IN THIS WORLD'S EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBUE OF ANOTHER THERE ARE NO FORTUNATE
4507-16021-0052 THE WILL HUMAN DIVISION IS THIS THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
4507-16021-0053 TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHABE TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
4507-16021-0054 THAT IS WHY WE CRIED EDUCATION SCIENCE
4507-16021-0055 TO TEACH READING MEANS TO LIGHT THE FIRE EVERY SYLLABLE SWELLED OUT SPARKLES
4507-16021-0056 HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SAY DROUET
4507-16021-0057 PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE LIGHT SUCCESS BURNS
4507-16021-0058 THE FLAME IS THE ENEMIES OF THE WING
4507-16021-0059 TO BURN WITHOUT CEASING TO LIE THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF GENIUS
4970-29093-0000 YOU'LL NEVER DID IT OUT OF THE AFTERNOON LIBRARY
4970-29093-0001 TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE OR ELSEWHERE THE PATH TO FORTUNE ARE INNUMERABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORIZON
4970-29093-0002 HE HAS NO TRADITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUARD HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
4970-29093-0003 THE MODEST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THRUST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF WHICH IN ITS STRAIN OR DOCTOR KANE
4970-29093-0004 HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD BE
4970-29093-0005 SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPICIOUS PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPEL OF REPENTANCE AND IT EVEN CROSS HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME MIDNIGHT REGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALE'S VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE BULLBLE SINGS ON THE OKNITES
4970-29093-0006 WALL SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK IN THE ANDY ROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SUBTLE GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICEES WITH THE ATTENDANT HEEDS AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTENDED BY THE ATTENDANT FEEDS
4970-29093-0007 IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITIOUS THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
4970-29093-0008 HE WANTED TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE LADDDER
4970-29093-0009 PHILIP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE ESTHER LIBRARY PLANNED LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED HIS GENIUS
4970-29093-0010 HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO SET INTO THE DIRKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAPE VINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
4970-29093-0011 OH VERY WELL SAID BRENDA TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
4970-29093-0012 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
4970-29093-0013 AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HISDIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD
4970-29093-0014 WELL I'M GOING AS NEAR YOU COULD GO AS ONE
4970-29093-0015 YOU CAN BEGIN BY CARRYING A RAWD AND PUTTING DOWN THE FIGURES
4970-29093-0016 NO IT'S OUGHT YOU SOON
4970-29093-0017 I'M BEEN READY TO GO ANYWHERE FOR SIX MONTHS
4970-29093-0018 THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALL STREET OFFICE OF HENRY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT LIVELY OPERATOR
4970-29093-0019 THE NIGHT WAS SPEND IN PACKING UP IN WRITING LETTERS FOR PHILIP WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
4970-29093-0020 WHY IT'S A MISERY SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WE'LL GET A MATTER
4970-29093-0021 I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEAR A HOME
4970-29093-0022 HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL LETTER
4970-29093-0023 HE WELL KNEW THE BARRELS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER
4970-29095-0000 SHE IS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS
4970-29095-0001 SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PIANO SAYING A SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY METALLIC VOICE AND THEN SEATED HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ PHILIP'S LETTER
4970-29095-0002 WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG STUDENT LOOKING AT WITH A SHAPE OF IMPATIENCE
4970-29095-0003 I HOPE THEYE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVE'S MUSIC THEE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
4970-29095-0004 I HEARD FATHER TELL COUSIN ADNER THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISTLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW
4970-29095-0005 THY WAYS GREATLY DRY ME RUTH AND ALL THY RELATIONS
4970-29095-0006 IS THY FATHER WILLING THEE SHOULD GO AWAY TO THE SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE
