3575-170457-0028 KHAZWICK MARCH TWENTY SECOND EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DEAR MADAME
3575-170457-0029 YOUR LETTER HAS GIVEN ME GREATER PLEASURE AND I SHOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DID NOT TELL YOU SO
3575-170457-0030 OF THIS SECOND LETTER ALSO SHE AWOKE AND TOLD ME THAT IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION FOR HER TO GO AND SEE THE POET IF EVER SHE VISITED THE LAKES
3575-170457-0031 ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SHE WRITE

3575-170457-0034 IN THOSE MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MIND THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
3575-170457-0035 I WISH YOU WILL RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE ENSTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
3575-170457-0036 MY EYES FILLS TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WANDERING IN THOUGHT INDEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH
3575-170457-0037 IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REPEEMER FOR A DIRECTION
3575-170457-0038 IN MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVA I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORRE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
3575-170457-0039 THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXTENDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELED THAT MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ER AND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL HE WAS DARK AND NO ONE SAW HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
3575-170457-0042 UNFORTUNATELY THE FACTURE COULD NOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT HER HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
3575-170457-0043 HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER I MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT AND MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF THE PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
3575-170457-0045 I HAVE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY
3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BROAD DAYS A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST SHOP IN HALL WORTH FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTORES IN NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBYS FRACTURE LEG
3575-170457-0047 DABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFULLY ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
3575-170457-0049 THE DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
3575-170457-0050 TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE MOTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY IN AGE
3575-170457-0051 AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SIGHED AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0052 SHE HAD ANOTHER WAITED ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
3575-170457-0053 BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUFFER DIS BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCH OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0054 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRATED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO AND STATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAYS SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FINAL ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0056 I DOUBT WHETHER BROWN RAW WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID COUPLE TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TOO AN INSECT
3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEY HAUGHTY AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
3729-6852-0003 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCOVERRA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCUURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERYONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURES SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
3729-6852-0005 SYLVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF NARIVO FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO PROSTERITY
3729-6852-0006 SYLVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GREAT CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HERSELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARRY ANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MARAVEAU AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONORABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SAVARE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTIAN INTOLERNCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PROLONGING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIA DIES
3729-6852-0010 I NEVER HAD ANYTHING FAMILY
3729-6852-0011 I HAD A NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
3729-6852-0012 I SHALL CALL YOU E SPREY
3729-6852-0013 YOU TOO ME A GREAT HONOUR
3729-6852-0014 HERE GO AND GET ME CHANGE FOR LOUISE I HAVE IT SIR
3729-6852-0015 IN YOUR SERVICE SIR
3729-6852-0016 MADAME QUINCEAL BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR INQUIRIES
3729-6852-0017 I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIGHER AT THE RATE OF ONE SOUP MEN READING THE NEWSPAPER UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE OR IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE
3729-6852-0018 I SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE A WEARER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO INQUIRE MY WISHES
3729-6852-0019 THEY TELL HIM TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
3729-6852-0020 THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURSE TO THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0021 I THINK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVE
3729-6852-0022 I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY ITILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
3729-6852-0023 MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER IMPERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
3729-6852-0024 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYONE STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
3729-6852-0025 IS THERE NOT A ARABIAN EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0026 YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYALE IS THE MOST EXACT
3729-6852-0027 THAT IS TRUE BADELFREE
3729-6852-0028 ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITED THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED
3729-6852-0029 IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE SAVETTE CAT
3729-6852-0030 IS IT BETTER THAN ANYWHERE HOUSE
3729-6852-0031 BUT TILL HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE
3729-6852-0032 SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FELT AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
3729-6852-0033 YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS CERTAINLY A DAUGHTER OF WHICH THE WORLD HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR LILYNESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT
3729-6852-0034 LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MET BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
3729-6852-0035 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSIONED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
3729-6852-0036 WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT VEVE LE ROY
3729-6852-0037 SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
3729-6852-0038 WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM AM MY FORTUNE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
3729-6852-0039 HE HIMSELF RECIPITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
3729-6852-0040 FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT HE WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
3729-6852-0041 I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEEL THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
3729-6852-0042 I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIAL AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
3729-6852-0043 I RESIDE IN THE MARREES GREW DE DUCEPORT
3729-6852-0044 I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRESH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU INSATIABLE
3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY RABBITES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOW HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DE SAINTS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A JERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUS OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY EPHILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TO DAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE HAVE A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WORDS EACHWARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLIMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTED ORGANIZATIONS
4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS MUSCLES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BILLING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HESITATE THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW AN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY FOR TRUTH
4077-13751-0006 THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SOME NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSILLATING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
4077-13751-0007 THE BOOKCAMOREMENT HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMINISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK OF MOREMAN STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF KURTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVENT LATTER DAYS SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES A MIZIE INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MASURIANS
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LITTLE BURNED W BUGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMAN HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTED SYMPATHY WITH THEIR PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICLED BY HUMAN SCRIB
4077-13751-0014 MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CALLED WEALTH COUNTY THEREIN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHORE CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNT ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0017 OH WOULD A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBIGINSS DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE FOUDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13751-0019 WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS IT THE MORONS
4077-13751-0020 AS THE SAMPLE OF THE PRESS COMMONS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MASYRIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MIZIRI WITH GOVERNOR BOX AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS IN SIGHTED TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
4077-13754-0000 THE ARMY FOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT HIM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
4077-13754-0001 BUT A WORD THITHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOID'S ADVICE THAT PUCATED ORDER THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SUCCESSIONISTS
4077-13754-0003 MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WELL GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
4077-13754-0004 ALREADY IN EARTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST
4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NOR EAST NO WEST THEY STOOD POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN IN ARMS FOR THEIR COUNTRIES NEED
4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LATTER DAY SAINTS CALL CELESTRAL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF CELESTAL MARRIAGE POLITICALITY OF WIVES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE IN A LITTLE RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATES SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED IN AUTHORIZED RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHEREIN WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALIGNED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
4077-13754-0009 AT THE RECEPTION OF GENERAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE
4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS INACTED WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING POOR MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT MORE MENS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUASY
4077-13754-0012 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOUR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALITY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT IN A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE I FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURTS POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTENT SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FINE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS HARVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DURATION
4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
4077-13754-0015 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND APPRECIATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THAT PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL A STATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON ITS FINALEY HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
4446-2271-0000 MAINE HALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0001 HE HAD PRECONCY IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS
4446-2271-0002 IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON T
4446-2271-0003 IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS AND IVE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
4446-2271-0004 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MILL HALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF A HANDSOME AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
4446-2271-0005 SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE'S HAD HER BEST ON THE SECOND BACK
4446-2271-0006 HE'S BEEN WANTED TO MARRY HEAD OF THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
4446-2271-0007 SHE DOESN'T TAKE OFF WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW
4446-2271-0008 I REINER GOING ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
4446-2271-0009 MADE HOLLUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
4446-2271-0010 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S SOFTLY KING ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
4446-2271-0011 SIR HARRY TOWN MISTER BARLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0012 I SAY SIR PARRY THE LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
4446-2271-0013 YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE ARE BIG CONSCIOUS TO NIGHT BUT THE FIRST TIME
4446-2271-0014 WESTMAN AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
4446-2271-0015 A LITTLE ATTRACT OF NURSE POSSIBLY
4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE KEEN INTEREST IN A SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
4446-2271-0017 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WENT AFOOT WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD OF THE THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
4446-2271-0018 SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THE BOY AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
4446-2271-0019 AFTER THAT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET
4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY INSENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFT
4446-2271-0021 SHE MUST CARRY ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO
4446-2271-0022 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINS
4446-2271-0023 AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY GONE
4446-2271-0024 I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITHIN ME NOW
4446-2273-0000 KILDAR WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR

4446-2273-0020 I THINK WE DID SHE ANSWERED DEMARILY
4446-2273-0021 WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER ARE FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANCS BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
4446-2273-0022 THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD FORGIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
4446-2273-0023 THE STRANGE WOMEN AND HER PASSIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
4446-2273-0024 BARLEY STARTED WHEN HILL TO RANG A LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHAT DID YOU DO THAT
4446-2273-0025 IT WAS VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED BLAZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COFFEE
4446-2273-0026 HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY NEW PLAN
4446-2273-0027 WHEN SHE FINISHED ALEXANDER SHOOK HIMSELF OUT OF A REVERORY
4446-2273-0028 NONSENSE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SING ACCEPTED THE WAY MY MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER DID BEFORE ME
4446-2273-0029 IT'S REALLY TOO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SANG DON'T YOU FEEL IT
4446-2273-0030 ELZEVIR WENT OVER AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOR HER
4446-2273-0031 THEN JUST IN FRONT
4446-2273-0032 HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MISSY SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE
4446-2273-0033 FOR A LONG TIME NEITHER HELD AND NOR BARLY SPOKE
4446-2273-0034 HE FELT A TREMOR RUN THROUGH A SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
4446-2273-0035 PARTLY LEAN OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TOUCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES
4446-2273-0036 ALEXANDER CLINCHED THE TWO HANDS AT HIS SIDES
4446-2275-0000 THE STOP AT QUEENS TOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERCY WERE THINGS THAT HE NOTED DIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE
4446-2275-0001 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FONDLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
4446-2275-0002 ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALL WAY BUTTONING AND UN BUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HELD HIS LIVING ROOM
4446-2275-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED IT
4446-2275-0004 ALBERT DID NOT SIT DOWN
4446-2275-0005 I FELT IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDID WAS GOING TO TURNED UP
4446-2275-0006 I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SISTERADE OR COUSIN MIGHT WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG
4446-2275-0007 SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DREW UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
4446-2275-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME HEARTLY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
4446-2275-0009 I CUT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
4446-2275-0010 ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE BLAZ
4446-2275-0011 BARLY BENT LOWER OVER THE FIRE
4446-2275-0012 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATERPILLAR IN LEAF
4446-2275-0013 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TOO BARTLY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
4446-2275-0014 I CAN'T UNDERSTAND SEEING YOU MISERABLE

4446-2275-0017 BUT ITS WORSE NOW IT'S UNBEARABLE
4446-2275-0018 I GET NOTHING BUT MEMORY OUT OF EITHER
4446-2275-0019 THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USED TO BE THAT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE

4446-2275-0029 PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING BARILY AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY
4446-2275-0030 YES AND I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY

4446-2275-0044 YOU DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
4446-2275-0045 WITHOUT TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT
4507-16021-0000 CHAPTER ONE VIRGIN
4507-16021-0001 IT ENGENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LA PAG FOR WHICH RED THEFT AND A HELL LOCK A GRIN FOR WHICH RED HUNGER
4507-16021-0002 THUS ELDERNESSES THE MOTHER
4507-16021-0003 SHE HAS A SONFT AND A DAUGHTER HUNGER
4507-16021-0004 WHAT IS SLLING
4507-16021-0005 WE HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SORT OF OBJECTIONS
4507-16021-0006 SLANG IS O'DIOUS
4507-16021-0007 SLANG MAKES ONE SHIVER
4507-16021-0008 WHO DESIGNS THAT OF COURSE IT DOES
4507-16021-0009 WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GOLF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
4507-16021-0010 WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH BEAUTY ACCEPTED IN FULFILLED MERITS
4507-16021-0011 WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORE EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYWHERE
4507-16021-0012 WHY SHOULD THE ONE HALT ON THE WAY
4507-16021-0013 NOTHING IS MORE LUGGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLANG
4507-16021-0014 NOW WHEN HAS HORROR EVER EXCLUDDED STUDY
4507-16021-0015 SINCE ONE HAS MALADY BANNISHED MEDICINE
4507-16021-0016 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TURENTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING O HOW UGLY THAT IS
4507-16021-0017 HE WOULD BE LIKE A POLOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
4507-16021-0018 WHAT IS SLANG PRIVATELY SPEAKING
4507-16021-0019 IT WAS THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS
4507-16021-0020 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ETENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHYAN ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLING
4507-16021-0021 THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTERY WHO SAYS MY SKIP OF THE GUTTER THE HAIR DRESSER WHO SAYS MY MEALY BACK THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLING
4507-16021-0022 THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PRESTUSS
4507-16021-0023 THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LOAF CLEVERIFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BURNT THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALKS SLING
4507-16021-0024 ALGEBRA MEDICINE BOTUNY HAVE EACH THEIR SLANG
4507-16021-0025 TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A LANGUAGE OF COMBAT WHICH IS SLLING
4507-16021-0026 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MEN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVIL CIVILIZATION IS TO SERVED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO SPEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION ITSELF IT IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
4507-16021-0027 PHENICIAN VERY GOOD
4507-16021-0028 EVEN DIALECT LET THAT PAST
4507-16021-0029 TO THIS WE SUPPLY IN ONE WORD ONLY
4507-16021-0030 ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS BROKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND STUDY
4507-16021-0031 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH THE VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH TRACES PERMITTED
4507-16021-0032 HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WHERE CRAWL PELL MELL THOSE WHO BLEED IN THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO SUFFERS THOSE WHO INFLICTED IN THOSE WHO INFLICTED IT AND THOSE WHO INFLICTED
4507-16021-0033 DO WE REALLY KNOW THE AMOUNTER WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
4507-16021-0034 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERASED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
4507-16021-0035 TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLEDES IN EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0036 BACKS FORM ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE OTHER
4507-16021-0037 THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASKS IN PETAPHOR RAGS
4507-16021-0038 IN DE SKIES IT BECOMES HORRIBLE
4507-16021-0039 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARETICULATE WORD
4507-16021-0040 ONE THINKS ONE HITS HIGH DRESS TALKING
4507-16021-0041 IT IS UN INTELLIGIBLE IN THE DARK
4507-16021-0042 IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACK OR STILL IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSED SLING
4507-16021-0043 THE EARTH HAS NOT DEVOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A JAIL
4507-16021-0044 LIVE CLOSELY AT LIFE
4507-16021-0045 IT IS SO BAD THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
4507-16021-0046 EACH DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT GREE FOR ITS LITTLE CARE
4507-16021-0047 YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBE OF A SLANDER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE IN YOUR CONSCIENCE OF PUBLIC COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE OF PUBLIC CALLS
4507-16021-0048 THIS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO TO CLOSE ON
4507-16021-0049 THERE IS HARDLY ONE DAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND SONNE
4507-16021-0050 AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL CLASS WE ARE HAPPY
4507-16021-0051 IN THIS WORLDS EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBULE OF ANOTHER THERE ARE NO FORTUNE
4507-16021-0052 THE REAL HUMAN DIVISION IS THIS THE LOUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
4507-16021-0053 TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHAGGY TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
4507-16021-0054 THAT IS WHY WE PRIDE EDUCATION SCIENCE
4507-16021-0055 TO TEACH READING MEANS TO LIGHT THE FIRE EVERY SYLLABLE CELLED OUT SPARKLES
4507-16021-0056 HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SEE JOY
4507-16021-0057 PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE LIGHT EXPRESS BURNS
4507-16021-0058 THE FLAME IS THE ARMY OF THE WING
4507-16021-0059 TO BURN WITHOUT CEASING TO FLYING THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF GENIUS
4970-29093-0000 YOU'LL NEVER DID IT OUT OF THE AFTER A LIBRARY
4970-29093-0001 TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE WERE ELSEWHERE THE PATHS TO FORTUNE ARE INNUMERABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORIZON
4970-29093-0002 HE HAS NO TRADITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUIDE HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OBSERVATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
4970-29093-0003 THE MODEST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THRUST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF WHICH IN ITS STRAIN OR DOCTOR CAME
4970-29093-0004 HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD BE
4970-29093-0005 SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPICIOUS PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPEL OF REPENTANCE AND IT EVEN CROSS HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME MIDNIGHT REGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALE'S VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE BULLBLE SINGS ON THE OKNIGHTS
4970-29093-0006 WALL SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK IN THE ANDY ROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SUBTLE GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICEES WITH THE ATTENDANT HEED AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTENDED BY THE ATTENDANT REEDS
4970-29093-0007 IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FINDATION
4970-29093-0008 SHE WANTED TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE LADDER
4970-29093-0009 VELVET THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE AFTER LIBRARY PLANNED LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED HIS GENIUS
4970-29093-0010 HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO SIT INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAPE VINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
4970-29093-0011 OH VERY WELL SAID GRIMOW TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
4970-29093-0012 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THINKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FILL
4970-29093-0013 AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO A LITERARY WORLD
4970-29093-0014 WELL I'M GOING AS ANY ENGINEER YOU COULD GO AS ONE
4970-29093-0015 YOU CAN BEGIN BY TEARING A ROD AND PUTTING DOWN THE FIGURES
4970-29093-0016 NO IT'S SUCH YOU SOON
4970-29093-0017 I'VE BEEN READ TO GO ANYWHERE FOR SIX MONTHS
4970-29093-0018 THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALL STREET OFFICE OF HENRY'S UNCLE AND HAD TO TALK WITH THAT LIVELY OPERATOR
4970-29093-0019 THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP IN WRITING LETTERS FOR PHILIP WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEPS WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
4970-29093-0020 WHY IT'S AND MISERY SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WE'LL GET A MOUTH
4970-29093-0021 I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEARER HER HOME
4970-29093-0022 HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST HEARD HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL MATTER
4970-29093-0023 HE WELL KNEW THE PEARLS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER
4970-29095-0000 THAT SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS
4970-29095-0001 SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PIANO SAYING A SIMPLE SONG AND A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY METALLIC VOICE AND THEN SEEING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ PHILIP'S LETTER
4970-29095-0002 WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG STUDENT LOOKING AT WITH A SHAME OF IMPATIENCE
4970-29095-0003 I HOPE HEE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVE'S MUSIC THEE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
4970-29095-0004 I HEARD FATHER TELL COUSIN ELEANOR THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISTLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW
4970-29095-0005 THY WAYS GREATLY TRIED ME RUTH AND ALL THY RELATIONS
4970-29095-0006 IS THY FATHER WILLING THATE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE
