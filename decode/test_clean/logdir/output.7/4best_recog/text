6930-75918-0016 YES I NEED SUPPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TODAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-75918-0017 BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE WHILE COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
6930-75918-0018 THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIGHT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE
6930-75918-0019 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAG OF JET AND YELLOW FLAG STONES
6930-75918-0020 BRAGHALON WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVAL SLUMBERS OF MANIC CAMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT
6930-76324-0000 THE LAUGH MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY
6930-76324-0001 THEY WERE CERTAINLY NO NEARER THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
6930-76324-0002 THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS
6930-76324-0003 NOT WHAT IS THE SENSE OF IT TOO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT
6930-76324-0004 BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT ON HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACE HER COMPANION
6930-76324-0005 THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE COULDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL
6930-76324-0006 HERS HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME FRAME TWO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT
6930-76324-0007 NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHAS FROG
6930-76324-0008 I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT SPIN OF SOME YEARS AFTER ALL
6930-76324-0009 DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MINIATUR WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING
6930-76324-0010 WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT QUEER JOYCE
6930-76324-0011 MAY WORE ANY TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME SIN

6930-76324-0013 HE CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL
6930-76324-0014 THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PARE
6930-76324-0015 SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PYRAMELIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PANT TO THE OUTFIT
6930-76324-0016 THE LAWYER PROVED TOO MUCH FORM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
6930-76324-0017 OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSES
6930-76324-0018 HE MAKES IT SORT OF COZ HERE
6930-76324-0019 NOW ITS DUST OF FURNITURE IN PICTURES
6930-76324-0020 YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE OF VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
6930-76324-0021 SURFACE DOES AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE THE HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
6930-76324-0022 THEN SHE SOMEWHAT REMARKED
6930-76324-0023 AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVET ANY LEFT AS USUAL
6930-76324-0024 THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLEIDE IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
6930-76324-0025 WHY IT'S FLY IT AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING IN
6930-76324-0026 IS IT HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO ODD CORNERS
6930-76324-0027 FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER
6930-76324-0028 WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MISCHIEF HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING IN HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW CAPHER HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0002 ON WORDS SAID A DISTANT VOICE
6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLEST OF THE NIGHT
6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER IT WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005 WHAT WAS THE
6930-81414-0006 WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEAR DISTINCTLY ON THE SERVICE OF THE POND
6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIT TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT SECOND OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CUTHBERT
6930-81414-0010 THE SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
6930-81414-0011 A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS WAKE WHERE
6930-81414-0012 SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNISE AS FULL TEARS CAPTURE
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOORED
6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW I HAVE DAZED BEWILDERED
6930-81414-0016 BUT THAT IS CAFFOR'S KNIFE
6930-81414-0017 I KNOW HE HAD IT THAT VERY EVENING
6930-81414-0018 I REMEMBERED SANG HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER
6930-81414-0019 OH CHAIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
6930-81414-0020 I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THESE MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLUSHED INTO MY MIND
6930-81414-0022 I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE ON THIS MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023 PERCHANCE TOO KARA'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024 MY TONGUE REFUSE TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME
6930-81414-0025 MY PHYSICIAN WAS TOO TERRIBLE
6930-81414-0026 MY OVER WROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
6930-81414-0027 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTANTLY
7021-79730-0000 THE THREE ROADS OF MANAGEMENT
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A CONSTITUTION IS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0002 BUT REASON AND AFFECTION
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR SERGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AND IRREPARABLE INJURY
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICIAL
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME PRETENDEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY REALISE PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE TILL WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MERRY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE ORATED
7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TOO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0001 DELA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MEIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79740-0002 NOW DILLIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE COMPOSITIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
7021-79740-0004 YOU HAVE COME AND BELLAH AND BELLAH WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S STALL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT
7021-79740-0005 I AM VERY BAD
7021-79740-0006 I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAD SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0009 THEY WERE NOW PLAIN WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR
7021-79740-0010 ELIA CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SET TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDDELA AND ROSILY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCULITUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE
7021-79740-0012 SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS SEE
7021-79740-0013 PUT THESE PLAY THINGS ALL WAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
7021-79740-0014 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID PERMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
7021-79759-0000 NATURE OF THE FACT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
7021-79759-0001 THAT YOU IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
7021-79759-0002 THEY ARE CHIEFLY INFORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-79759-0003 VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FINISHING
7021-79759-0004 WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH DREAM AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST IN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENT TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
7021-85628-0000 BUT ANDREW'S CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMB FOUND IT I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKIFE
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLAME WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AN ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKNIFE
7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THAT ANDERS
7021-85628-0005 SEEM THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
7021-85628-0006 I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED AND OTHERS
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK AND HER HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM AT THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008 FOR LAKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG NOSE
7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLIMMERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCE SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET AND HER SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO MAKE IT OFF
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE GUESSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014 YOU ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER ON HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016 THAT IS A VERY FINE CAMP YOU HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017 SO IT IS SAID ANDERSON
7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MAID OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP ANDORS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020 HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HOLLOWS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD OUT TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022 THEN ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERSON WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024 AND HER HIS FACE GREW RED
7021-85628-0025 BUT HIS MOTHER HUUGGED HIM CLOSE
7021-85628-0026 KNOW MY LITTLE SON SHE SAID
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED AND SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD CAUSED SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNORS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
7127-75946-0001 I VERY WELL
7127-75946-0002 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF CALBEAR HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF OCCOURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
7127-75946-0003 GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT AND YON AND VILERA TOOK THEIR LEAVE
7127-75946-0004 CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHO WHAT
7127-75946-0005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED JULIUS
7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY IS REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0007 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE WOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED
7127-75946-0008 DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL ATTENDANT
7127-75946-0009 NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO BE
7127-75946-0010 YOUR MAJESTY'S PLAN THEN IN THIS AFFAIR IS
7127-75946-0011 HE WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
7127-75946-0012 THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COCOATRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED AT AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0014 THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT GAZE OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PIECE IN ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0016 THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRIAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ANTSE
7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLOURED SILK AND HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BROYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEMED TO SOAR ALONG
7127-75946-0019 YES IT IS EXPRESSED
7127-75946-0020 FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVING GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED IT
7127-75946-0021 YES SIRE AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BATTLEET
7127-75946-0022 SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM THE SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
7127-75946-0023 THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERYONE PLEASANT
7127-75946-0024 MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY WOMAN WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
7127-75946-0025 THE VALLEY BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRE SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75946-0027 DISDAIN FULL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKET PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANNCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILL CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
7127-75947-0000 EVERYONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BE DIEMED
7127-75947-0001 UPON THIS MADAME DEIGN TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE CONTEMPT OBSERVING
7127-75947-0002 DO DO YOU THINK SO SHE REPLIED WITH INDIFFERENCE

7127-75947-0007 SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE
7127-75947-0008 THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALILY
7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTIOND HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
7127-75947-0010 WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF

7176-88083-0002 HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SALT TOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
7176-88083-0003 BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE ALELS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
7176-88083-0004 BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVINGCORRANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0005 ONCE FAIRLY AWING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH
7176-88083-0006 IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TRAUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
7176-88083-0007 BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ING GORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT AND SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
7176-88083-0008 IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TWO SOON
7176-88083-0009 THE GREAT HAWK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
7176-88083-0010 THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE SURPRISE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
7176-88083-0011 IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST FINISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED VELVET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
7176-88083-0012 THE HOOK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
7176-88083-0013 LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEARS HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGE WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
7176-88083-0014 THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS CORRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0015 ALMOST INSTANTLY HE HAS FORCED TO THE TOP
7176-88083-0016 STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM HIS PURSE AND DARTED AFTER HIM
7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT AND THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
7176-88083-0018 BUT THIS FREQUENTURE OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES IN THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALENTS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVES HEAD
7176-88083-0020 WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACHED
7176-88083-0021 BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND WHO WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
7176-88083-0022 THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARY HAD BECOME AS DAGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
7176-88083-0023 HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG PAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
7176-88083-0024 THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOLDING ITSELF FIRMLY
7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRDS TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
7176-88083-0026 THE DRAG UPON HIS BEACH AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
7176-88083-0027 THEN THE LEADER PARKED FROM THE LINE
7176-92135-0000 HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SUPPOSEDIUM ON THE PRICE OF GOLF FALLS
7176-92135-0001 IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN ENGLAND SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
7176-92135-0002 BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSAL DRAMAISM HAS HIS MOMENTS
7176-92135-0003 YOUR PLAIN MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
7176-92135-0004 FRANKLY I CAN ALWAYS SAY
7176-92135-0005 BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY MATTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH
7176-92135-0006 I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PART A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
7176-92135-0007 ANYHOW HE'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUE ALL RIGHT
7176-92135-0008 LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGE CRAFT IS
7176-92135-0009 AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HUMBLY ON SAID LIQUY

7176-92135-0012 INDEED IRRESOLUTION MEAN THE KEEN OUT OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JOB BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATICS MEANING
7176-92135-0013 WE MODERNS HOWEVER SEEK THE ABSURDITY OF IT
7176-92135-0014 IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TAKE THINK HOW SHALL A SYLICALLY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
7176-92135-0015 AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN A VILLAGE MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTEE OF THAT SORT
7176-92135-0016 THIS WOULD BE AN EASI WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
7176-92135-0017 AND THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS COMPONENCE
7176-92135-0018 IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS EM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL

7729-102255-0000 THE OLDEST LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
7729-102255-0001 THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ERECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
7729-102255-0002 THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STAGE GREATLY CHANGE THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
7729-102255-0003 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NEW MIRACLE STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BOARD RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURNED THE SCALE
7729-102255-0004 THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORYIAL OFFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE MOGUS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY

7729-102255-0011 THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SALIEANT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR AND KANSAS WHICH HAPPILY ARE NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY AND A LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE
7729-102255-0012 SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATEMEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
7729-102255-0013 IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF ITS STATE
7729-102255-0014 THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN

7729-102255-0017 JEFF JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION BUT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT

7729-102255-0040 IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSETTS FINDS ITS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPHANT INDICATION
7729-102255-0041 THE WHOLE PRECEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISCUSS TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND EXCESSARIES

8224-274381-0001 AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD HAPPIER OF MURCHISON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
8224-274381-0002 WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCALCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
8224-274381-0003 THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSES COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CALLS IN SCOTLAND
