1089-134686-0000 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOWER FATTEN SAUCE
1089-134686-0001 STUFF IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNCILED HIM
1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BRAFELS
1089-134686-0003 HOW BARTIE ANY GOOD IN YOUR MIND
1089-134686-0004 NUMBER DAN FRESH NELLIE IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBAND
1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLRY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
1089-134686-0006 THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
1089-134686-0007 A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE RANGED IN HIS SOUL
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOUR DISTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ELMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
1089-134686-0010 WELL NOW ANIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0011 ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SOUDELITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
1089-134686-0012 HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134686-0013 IFEVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER NIGHT
1089-134686-0014 HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT GOOD BE
1089-134686-0015 BUT THE DUST DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
1089-134686-0016 THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECHISM ENDLESS
1089-134686-0017 STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HARON CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
1089-134686-0018 IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARRED PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
1089-134686-0019 THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROUP IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
1089-134686-0020 IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO A MASS OF HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY WHERE THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST A CREWING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
1089-134686-0021 IF A LAYMON IN GIVING BAPTISM POOR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
1089-134686-0022 HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST B ATTITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND THE ATTITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
1089-134686-0023 WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE UCARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
1089-134686-0024 IF THE WINE CHANGING TO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
1089-134686-0025 A GENTLE QUICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
1089-134686-0026 THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATACHISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM
1089-134686-0027 YOU CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
1089-134686-0028 THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOR OF SAINT FRANCIS ZEVIIER WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
1089-134686-0029 ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEAIDS
1089-134686-0030 BEWARE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKES
1089-134686-0031 STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FID WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER
1089-134686-0032 HE IS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIOUS
1089-134686-0033 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCE'S SAVIOUR
1089-134686-0034 THE RECTOR PAUSEED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASP TO HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
1089-134686-0035 HE HAD THE FAITHFUL IN HIM THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS
1089-134686-0036 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS'S SAVIOUR
1089-134686-0037 IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWNEY GLOW
1089-134691-0000 SHE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0001 FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND NOW WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0002 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE MERRICK AND WAS SAFE
1089-134691-0003 THE GENEROSITY
1089-134691-0004 RIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
1089-134691-0005 WHOSE FIT ARE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS
1089-134691-0006 THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICERS HE HAD REFUSED
1089-134691-0007 SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS CHARMING AND RESOUNDING
1089-134691-0008 THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVED BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
1089-134691-0009 ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE CAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HITTY
1089-134691-0010 BROTHER MACARTLE BROTHER KYELF
1089-134691-0011 THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRIVED HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TEN FOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
1089-134691-0012 IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGARS WEEDES THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
1089-134691-0013 IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINELY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE SORTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE MADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
1089-134691-0014 THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SEEN HARMONIZED IN ACCORD
1089-134691-0015 BIRDS WAS IT THEIR COLORS
1089-134691-0016 THEY WERE VOYAGEING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NO MADS ON THE MARCH VOAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
1089-134691-0017 THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEY AND WOULD BEGIRT AND CITADELS AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALD RACES
1089-134691-0018 AGAINST AGAIN
1089-134691-0019 A VOICE FROM BEYOND THAT WORLD WAS CALLING
1089-134691-0020 HELLO STEPHAN US HERE COMES THE DEVILUS
1089-134691-0021 THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HUME STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WEFT LUSTRE
1089-134691-0022 HE STOOD STILL INDIFFERENT TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
1089-134691-0023 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
1089-134691-0024 STEPHANUS DEAR LOSS
1089-134691-0025 A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAIZZ WRAPPED CITY
1188-133604-0000 YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TISSION HOLINE TURNER AND TENTHORET AND ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
1188-133604-0001 THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFER TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS PURE A SCOREISTS
1188-133604-0002 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURASCUOUS DEVOTS HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE AND ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
1188-133604-0003 MY FIRST IMPRINCABLE REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE
1188-133604-0004 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALIZE HARD AT THE EDGE
1188-133604-0005 IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CORPOCIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
1188-133604-0006 THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAN OF IT
1188-133604-0007 THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK AS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE
1188-133604-0008 FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY GRATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE READ AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS AN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
1188-133604-0009 NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GREEDATED JUSTLY
1188-133604-0010 BUT IN THIS VEINIA COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
1188-133604-0011 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GREY PAPER
1188-133604-0012 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORISTS WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
1188-133604-0013 IT MUST REMAIN BE ONE OR THE OTHER
1188-133604-0014 DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONE
1188-133604-0015 THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL WAS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DEGRADIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELLERS WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
1188-133604-0017 THAT AS STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDTY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
1188-133604-0019 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AN ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
1188-133604-0020 BUT OBSERVE YOU COULD ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0022 YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCHEME YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
1188-133604-0023 THE COLOREST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STEADY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
1188-133604-0025 YOU KNOW I'VE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST AND CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0026 HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELLOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO IN THE PITHON
1188-133604-0027 NOW HERE IS ROUGH IEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
1188-133604-0028 WHILE THEN LAST HE IS TURNERS GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0029 ONLY THERE ARE TWO SOURCES OF CLOUD IN FIRE
1188-133604-0030 HE KNOWS THEM BATH
1188-133604-0031 THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER THE DODLEY AND THE FLINT
1188-133604-0032 IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINE BY EDWARD BURN JONES AND ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
1188-133604-0033 EVERY PLANT AND THE GRASS IS SET FORMERLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
1188-133604-0034 EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHOSSER AND HIS TENDER MOOD IN OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
1188-133604-0035 THUS IN CHUSTER'S DREAM
1188-133604-0036 IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THE SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
1188-133604-0037 EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN MORE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLINE OR JUR
1188-133604-0038 BUT NOW HERE IS THE SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHILE TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
1188-133604-0039 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS IN ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
1188-133604-0040 THE TRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
1188-133604-0041 IT IS A GLEAMER BRINGING DOWN HER ONE SHEEP OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN
1188-133604-0042 THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY AARCADIAN
1188-133604-0043 SEE THAT YOUR LIES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOYS CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED HEIGHT
1188-133604-0044 IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF HEIGHTS FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WARWOLF AND THE GUEREGO
121-121726-0000 ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICNTIC SEASON
121-121726-0001 HARAGUE THE TIRESOME PRODUCT OF A TIRELESS TONGUE
121-121726-0002 ANGOR PAIN PAINFUL TO HEAR
121-121726-0003 HAY FEVER A HARD TROUBLE CAUSED BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GRASS WIDOW
121-121726-0004 SEVEN A GOOD PLACE TO BE RAISED TO
121-121726-0005 EDGE OF FENCE
121-121726-0006 HEREREDITY THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
121-121726-0007 HORSE SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BEDDING ON THE RACES
121-121726-0008 OHS MAN'S EXCUSE FOR WETTING THE WALK
121-121726-0009 HOW TAIL A PLACE WHERE A GUEST OFTEN GIVES UP GOOD DOLLARS FOR POOR QUARTERS
121-121726-0010 HOUSE CLEANING A DOMESTIC UP HEVAL THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL THE SOLDIERS IT NEEDS
121-121726-0011 HUSBAND THE NEXT THINGS TO A WIFE
121-121726-0012 HUSY WOMAN AND BOND TIE
121-121726-0013 TI TIDE TO A WOMAN
121-121726-0014 HYPOCRITE A WORSE DEALER
121-123852-0000 THOSE PRETTY WRONGS THAT LIBERTY COMMITS WHEN I AM SOME TIME ABSENT FROM THY HEART THY BEAUTY AND THY YEARS FALL WELL BEFEITS FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHERE THOU ART
121-123852-0001 I MEAN
121-123852-0002 NO MATTER THEN ALTHOUGH MY FOOT DID STAND UPON THE FARTHEST EARTH MOVED FROM THEE FOR NIMBLE THOUGHT CAN JUMP BOTH SEA AND LAND AS SOON AS THINK THE PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE BUT AH
121-123852-0003 THOUGHT KILLS ME THAT I AM NOT THOUGHT TO LEAP LARGE LENGTHS OF MILES WHEN THOU ART GONE BUT THAT SO MUCH OF EARTH AND WATER ROOT I MUST ATTEND TIMES LEISURE WITH MY MOAN RECEIVING NOT BY ELEMENTS SO SLOW BUT HEAVY TEARS BADGES OF EITHERS WOE
121-123852-0004 MY HEART DOTH PLEAD THAT THOU IN HIM DOST LIE A CLOSET NEVER PIERCED WITH CRISTEL EYES BUT THE DEFENDANT DOTH THAT PLE DENY AND SAYS IN HIM THY FAIR APPEARANCE LIES
121-123859-0000 YOU ARE MY ALL THE WORLD AND I MUST STRIVE TO KNOW MY SHAMES AND PRAISES FROM YOUR TONGUE NONE ELSE TO ME NOR I TO NONE ALIVE THAT MY SEALED SENSE OR CHANGES RIGHT OR WRONG

121-123859-0003 LOVE IS A BABE THAT MIGHT I NOT SAY SO TO GIVE FULL GROWTH TO THAT WHICH STILL DOTH GROW
121-123859-0004 SO I RETURNED REBUKED TO MY CONTENT AND GAINED BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT
121-127105-0000 IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT GREW FROM DOUGLAS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
121-127105-0001 SOME ONE ELSE TOLD HIS STORY NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING
121-127105-0002 CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF AND INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF
121-127105-0003 THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THIS AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED
121-127105-0004 THE STORM IS WRITTEN
121-127105-0005 I COULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND CLOSE THE KEY HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT
121-127105-0006 THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPONMENT BUT IT WAS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THAT CHARMED ME
121-127105-0007 TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT OH SAINT GOD NOW AND IS THE RECORD YOURS
121-127105-0008 HE HUNG THE FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN'S
121-127105-0009 HER HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS
121-127105-0010 SHE SENT ME THE PAGES AND QUESTIONED BEFORE SHE DIED
121-127105-0011 SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER
121-127105-0012 MUSTN'T SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
121-127105-0013 YOU'LL LEISURELY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
121-127105-0014 YOU ARE EXECUTE
121-127105-0015 HE QUIWITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
121-127105-0016 PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND HOST
121-127105-0017 IT IS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY
121-127105-0018 CRYING THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
121-127105-0019 MISSUS GRIEFFIN HOWEVER EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR LITTLE MORE LIGHT
121-127105-0020 WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT IN ANY NATURAL VULGAR WAY NOR'S THE PITY THEN
121-127105-0021 WON'T YOU TELL DODGLAS
121-127105-0022 WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHOM HE WAS
121-127105-0023 LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRASCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
121-127105-0024 POOR DOUCLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
121-127105-0025 THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RANGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP
121-127105-0026 THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHERS CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TAIL AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
121-127105-0027 HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE OF BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
121-127105-0028 THE AWKWARD THINK WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
121-127105-0029 THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN A GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
121-127105-0030 I DO'T ANTICIPATED
121-127105-0031 SHE WAS YOUNG ANDTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY FOR REALLY GREAT LONELINESS
121-127105-0032 YES BUT THATS JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
121-127105-0033 ITS WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT
121-127105-0034 IT SOUNDED DULL THAT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE OR BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS
121-127105-0035 SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MEANT TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
121-127105-0036 SUCH WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
1221-135766-0000 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERYDAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THROUGH ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0001 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
1221-135766-0002 YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HAS HER PRINT LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COE EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY IT'S ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004 THIS OUTWARD MUT ABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESSED THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0005 HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS COMBINING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MOURNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRINT NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF AIRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUCE SEVERITY
1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO COMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESS TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT ROLLED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANYED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HAVE QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0011 BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE HEALTH IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DE LUCIVE
1221-135766-0012 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED OF SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0013 PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INVENTILE WORLD
1221-135766-0014 PEARLS SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
1221-135766-0015 HAVE SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
1221-135767-0000 HESTER PRINT WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLING HAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FURNISHED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE BORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THE FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONORABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY
1221-135767-0001 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK IN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0002 AT THAT EPOCH OF CHRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND A FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
1221-135767-0003 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MOTIFICATION OF THE FRAME WORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
1221-135767-0004 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY A KIND TO BLACK
1221-135767-0005 IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH WIFE
1221-135767-0006 THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE READ IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
1221-135767-0007 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HE HAS TO CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
1221-135767-0008 COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLEE MUD AT THEM
1221-135767-0009 BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER DROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0010 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VALUE OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSE THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0011 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CAPITALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DOORABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
1221-135767-0012 THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM ANDFLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
1221-135767-0013 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL AFTER PRINT GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BONDS SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISH MAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
1221-135767-0014 YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE ALLEAGE
1221-135767-0015 IT MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
1221-135767-0016 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0017 ON THE TABLE AND TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PUTER TANKERED AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROSTY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
1221-135767-0018 LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONT ASPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE
1221-135767-0019 MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LUCK
1221-135767-0020 AND TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1221-135767-0021 PEARL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBRY
1221-135767-0022 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0023 THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANIMALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF THE BOWL
1221-135767-0024 PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR OUR REDROWS AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
1284-1180-0000 HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRADEED WITH GOLD
1284-1180-0001 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN OF A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
1284-1180-0002 INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAIN
1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF EYES IN WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0004 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE AND SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
1284-1180-0005 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHY THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0006 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE LUNCHINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLICANS THE PATH DIVIDED
1284-1180-0007 HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST LABOUR
1284-1180-0008 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON DONK AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD LUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PITT
1284-1180-0010 ANK KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
1284-1180-0011 I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOMED MY HOME
1284-1180-0012 WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELYR PLACE THAN THIS ALONE MERE PLACE
1284-1180-0013 AND YOU MUST BE ODOUR THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
1284-1180-0014 O KOYO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
1284-1180-0015 WE'RE TRAVELLING REPLIED UDO AND WE STOP AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
1284-1180-0016 THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFULLY
1284-1180-0017 AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROAD ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0018 IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FROM MY GOOD WIFE MARBLE LOT WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
1284-1180-0019 YOU MUST KNOW SAID MAGUA WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAMBIE THE WITCH WHO USED TO LEAVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLICANS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
1284-1180-0020 THE FIRST THOUGHT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0021 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAP THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND THEY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
1284-1180-0022 I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF EYES
1284-1180-0023 YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITHOUT MONKY THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
1284-1180-0024 THAT IS ONE REASON YOUR HOST THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN SYMPATHETIC TONE
1284-1180-0025 I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGARET LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
1284-1180-0026 BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COPE THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
1284-1180-0027 YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASI AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
1284-1180-0028 A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLOURS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SO TOGETHER
1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY WILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLOURS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1180-0030 WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TIME TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE BUNCHKINS ARE
1284-1180-0031 AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OSMELIERE'S GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
1284-1180-0032 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD CHARM I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
1284-1181-0000 O STILL EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
1284-1181-0001 MARGUERITE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCH WERE QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCH WORK SKIRT AND IN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAME MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
1284-1181-0002 THE HEAD OF THE PATCH WORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRADES
1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF US AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
1284-1181-0005 NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT TO BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MAGUA BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TWO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT IN HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0007 SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTOMS
1284-1181-0008 I THING THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBANDSIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR CATTLES FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0010 THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTLE OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POVERTY OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
1284-1181-0013 OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLEES
1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A BELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0016 I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKENED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0017 THE WIZARD OF OURS WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLENDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERERS
1284-1181-0018 IT TRULY IS ASSERT OF THE MAGICIAN
1284-1181-0019 I NOW USE THEM AS ORDINARAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
1284-1181-0020 DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTER BOX ARE GETTING TO BE INK REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
1284-1181-0021 ASK THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
1284-134647-0000 THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTERESTS
1284-134647-0001 THE EDICT OF MALAND THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERRATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR EMBIED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SEX WHICH DESCENDED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND DEPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
1284-134647-0003 CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A REASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIOCLETION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0005 THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTASION OF GUILT AND SKISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED IN VIOLET THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONITTISTS
1284-134647-0007 PRESCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DRAMATIST STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN MEDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
1320-122612-0000 SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAD SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
1320-122612-0001 THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELLERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKI WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULATE WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOUR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGO WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
1320-122612-0005 YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCARRONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
1320-122612-0006 LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEEN HER EYES
1320-122612-0007 CHIN GATCH BOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND LED THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BENDING
1320-122612-0010 SEE SAID UNCUS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
1320-122612-0011 IF A ROCK OR RIVALET OR BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
1320-122612-0012 EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE AWFULS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES WORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN ROUSED BY THE HORSES
1320-122612-0013 A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGNMENT FOR HIS PORTION
1320-122612-0014 THE EXPLANATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST ALIVION
1320-122612-0016 RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF A SINGER'S FOOT
1320-122617-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HACKEY HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
1320-122617-0001 IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTICED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
1320-122617-0002 IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BAILEMS ASKED TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SCEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
1320-122617-0003 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS HEIR AND A MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0004 THE INGENIOUS HOT EYE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
1320-122617-0005 THE BAR SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
1320-122617-0006 CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DON UPON HIM
1320-122617-0007 COME COME RETURNED LECOQ UNCACING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
1320-122617-0008 THE YOUNG MAN IS IN VANDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
1320-122617-0009 I GREATLY MOURNED THAT ONE SO WELL SUPPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HIM CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
1320-122617-0010 THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAN MUTIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
1320-122617-0011 THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCEST WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
1320-122617-0012 FOUR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
1320-122617-0013 DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS AND AN ANIMAL SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
1320-122617-0014 THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED TO THE SUPPOSED CONGURER TO ENTER
1320-122617-0015 BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED THE SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0016 THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TO CONTINUED DAVID APPROVING THE HAND HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
1320-122617-0017 THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLIGHTLY ENTERED THE PLACE
1320-122617-0018 IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE ANDLIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOKERY
1320-122617-0019 UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITHHS
1320-122617-0020 THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THE PRIVACY
1320-122617-0021 WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGLES AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THE SINGERS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
1320-122617-0022 THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOUS AND THEY OUTSTRIPED THE DEER
1320-122617-0023 UNCUS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR AND READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
1320-122617-0024 BUT HAK I WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF INTO HIS COMPANION
1320-122617-0025 SO ANXIOUS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
1320-122617-0026 WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MEN COURAGE AND WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
1320-122617-0027 AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTY INSTRUCTIONS
1320-122617-0028 MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLE THAT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS
