237-134493-0016 ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE HE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL OSAGE ORON CHES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0017 ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDROV BURGSON
237-134493-0018 THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEHIVES AND THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES
237-134500-0000 FRANK READ ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRY OR HE GREW
237-134500-0001 MARI SIGHED
237-134500-0002 A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVEN PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0003 THE ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING OF THE SUN
237-134500-0004 THAT INFORMATION DECIDED HER
237-134500-0005 OH BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE FOOD
237-134500-0006 JUST SMELL THE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPUCY AFTER A RAIN
237-134500-0007 WE NEVER HAD SO MANY OF THE MEN HEAR BEFORE
237-134500-0008 I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WORST SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TWO
237-134500-0009 I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE ONE SEASON TOO THEN
237-134500-0010 IT'S EXCITEING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST AND TO GET THE GRASSKUT
237-134500-0011 AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOK AT THE SPIDER WHIPS ALL OVER THE GRASS
237-134500-0012 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHARIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SIDE WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN
237-134500-0013 MERRY PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING RANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0014 AND EAMIO MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN CHIPARTA AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
237-134500-0016 I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW THEN THINGS ARE
237-134500-0017 IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEAR THAT WAY
237-134500-0018 HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INCIPID FRUIT LONG IVORY COLOURED BERRIES TIPPED WITH MATE PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
237-134500-0019 HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HIS LAP
237-134500-0020 HE YES DON'T YOU
237-134500-0021 OH EVER SO MUCH ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAYED IN SCHOOL TEACHERY
237-134500-0022 WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER HE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
237-134500-0023 IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH CARRO
237-134500-0024 I LIKE TO TALK TO CARDINAL ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE
237-134500-0025 OH AIMIO
237-134500-0026 SURELY YOUR ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF THERE
237-134500-0027 BARBICANE'S FACE FELL UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE
237-134500-0028 I'M SURE ALEXANDER HOPEDS YOU WILL STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED
237-134500-0029 I DON'T WANT TO STAND AROUND OF THE GONE
237-134500-0030 I'VE WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
237-134500-0031 SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A CLERK SO LIKE A TABLECLOTH
237-134500-0032 I AT TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
237-134500-0033 I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO RESTLESS AND COULDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
237-134500-0034 I THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY
237-134500-0035 AND HE NEVER USED TO BE CROSSED TO ME
237-134500-0036 I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MEARY
237-134500-0037 BUT E MEAL IF I UNDERSTAND IN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
237-134500-0038 AND ANYHOW THERE'S NOTHING TOO UNDERSTAND
237-134500-0039 THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY USED DO
237-134500-0040 I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THATS NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF
237-134500-0041 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAYER NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
237-134500-0042 THAN ALL OUR GOOD THINGS ARE OVER
260-123286-0000 YESTERDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKE IN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
260-123286-0001 THE HORIZON MEANS EXTREMELY DISTANT
260-123286-0002 ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESOLVED ITS SWAY
260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE EX
260-123286-0004 ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THEN NOW
260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE ROAD IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEAT IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0006 WE ARE VISITING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT
260-123286-0007 HE CALLED THE SEA UPON AT OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
260-123286-0008 THEREFORE DON'T TALKING TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS
260-123286-0009 I TAKE THIS IS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LOOKS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0010 FRIDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH
260-123286-0011 NOTHING KNEW WHETHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESH ENDS
260-123286-0012 BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON FOR FEAR
260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE REST WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0014 TRULY THE SEA IS OF INFINITE WITH
260-123286-0015 IT MUST BE AS WILD AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS'S LEAVE
260-123286-0017 I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THREE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HAMBOURED MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0019 I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICKED HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE
260-123286-0020 TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH IT
260-123286-0021 FIRING HIS WATCH I SLEPT
260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK OBEY ME
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PINCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
260-123286-0024 THERE'S A WELL AWAY CRIED THE PROFESSOR
260-123286-0025 FIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTALS ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRADES
260-123286-0026 TWO MONSTERS ONLY WERE CREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO RENTALS OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
260-123286-0027 I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF ICHTHEA SORUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COE AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
260-123286-0028 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALST IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
260-123286-0029 THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACK EACH EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
260-123286-0030 SUDDENLY THE ICHTHEA SORUS AND THE PLUSIOUS SOURCE DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WARPOLE EDDYING IN THE WATER
260-123286-0031 AS FOR THE ITHEOSORUS HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMERIN CABRN
260-123288-0000 THE ROARINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DARKNESS
260-123288-0001 THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THE TERM WOULD CHANGE BEFORE LONG
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PER VADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SAILING WATERS
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE TO THE DANCE CURTAIN WHICH IS WRAPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004 THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS COME
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEASY TUFT OF MISTS WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GRAY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AND A PENETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0006 THE ATMOSPHERE AS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SIR CHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
260-123288-0007 THE WIND NEVER LOLLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOE OF FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
260-123288-0008 WHERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
260-123288-0009 THOSE CROWD SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF ALLOWMENT SAINT ELBOW'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LAD
260-123288-0011 BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSTIZE US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0012 THAT WILL BE THE SAFEST NO NOW NEVER
260-123288-0013 THE PILED UP VAPOURS CONTENTS IN THE WATER AND THE AIR PUT IN THE VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUM LEFT BY THE CONENSATION OF THE MIST ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0014 HANS STIRS NIGHT
260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL A MISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT THE ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLLICULES THE GASIUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLIGHTED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0016 I REFER TO THE THE THERMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
260-123288-0017 IS THE ATMOSPHERE CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED THE DESTINY TO BECOME FINAL
260-123288-0018 THE LAND BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
260-123288-0019 AT NOON THE GLANCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
260-123288-0020 EACH OF US IS LESSHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
260-123288-0021 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE THEIR HEADS
260-123288-0022 I SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
260-123288-0023 HE NODS HIS COSETTE
260-123288-0024 THE FIRE BALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHOW MOVED SOLELY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN ACCESS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GUIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLEING LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HAUNTS WHO FIXS HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NONSENSE FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS
260-123288-0028 WE SUFFER STIFLING PAIN
260-123440-0000 AND HOW AWKWARD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
260-123440-0001 POOR OFFICE
260-123440-0002 IT WAS THE WHITE RAPID RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUTCHST THE DUCHESS
260-123440-0003 WHY WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
260-123440-0004 ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT BAYNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
260-123440-0005 AND YESTERDAY THINKS WAIT ON JUST AS USUAL
260-123440-0006 I'LL WONDER IF I'D BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
260-123440-0007 I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING WAS LITTLE DIFFERENT
260-123440-0008 I'LL TRY IF I NO ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GOT TO TWENTY AT THAT RIGHT
260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHS IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
260-123440-0011 NO I'VE MADE IT MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M MAYBE I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
260-123440-0012 IT'LL BE NO USE TRE PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SANG COME UP AGAIN DEAR
260-123440-0013 I AM SO VERY TIRED BEING ALL ALONE HERE
260-123440-0014 AND I DECLARE IT' IS TOO BAD THAT IT IS
260-123440-0015 I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWIM ABOUT TRYING TO FOUND HER WAY OUT
260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN EARS
260-123440-0017 THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE
260-123440-0018 I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OLD MOUSE
260-123440-0019 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE HOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
260-123440-0020 WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RENDER NOT WE INDEED
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US POLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM MIND HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER ANNE OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY UNGILLATIONS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME IMPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0004 HE WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
2830-3979-0005 THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDUCED
2830-3979-0006 A WORDS SHOULD NOW BE SET ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ANGLEATIONS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPLACE ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MIGILATIONS FOR INSTANCE AND
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO A STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GUATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CRIME MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LEECTURES IS THERE
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOP TWO
2830-3979-0012 THE WORK OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMUND THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE NATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LAST TO COME TO CHRIST
2830-3980-0003 TALK CAME LATER IN HIS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF COST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWONE HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE ACPOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY IN MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 POL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRICE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 PAAL AND APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROFITS AND APPPOSTLES
2830-3980-0011 PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APPPOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM AS THAT THEY WERE SPENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONS THE APOSTALS FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014 THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LATELY
2830-3980-0015 FOR PERSON THE POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016 IT SPOILS ONE'S BESTWORK
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TWO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0019 I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SO FATIGUE INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SENSIBLE PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021 AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE BED
2830-3980-0022 THE CLASS SEEMED SUPERVOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTORS OF THE ROTTENNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE BATTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CRIES ONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 FIRST THREE
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BRETHREME WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOUSE TO THE FALSE APPOSTLES
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BROTHERN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACH AS I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WITH THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE QUESTIONS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WHY DID THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE OF THEM BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HATH NOT SEEN NOR EITHER HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE GLORIOUS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034 THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTEMMINATED
2830-3980-0035 THEY REMAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MENS OPINION
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTIGRIST REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPSEL NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0038 GRACIOUS BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH HALL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLET IS REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041 GRACE INVOLVES THE R MISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD READS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVES THUS
2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRIEF AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045 THEY SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAME FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND IS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVE AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049 EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET WITHOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAID I AM THE WAY IN THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARGUING ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS THEIR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS ARE PREACHED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL SCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER DOES THIS SPENSE GRACE IN PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO BE BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE POLICY SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THE AREANCE TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HALY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059 POLS STICKS TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060 HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS A PUZZL
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASSION LANDS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR YOUR GOODNESS BEFORE OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063 UNDER SCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSEQUENCES
2830-3980-0064 HOW MAY WE OBTAIN RECOGNITION OF OUR SINS
2830-3980-0065 PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO HAS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WE CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THIS INSTANCE ALSO TO FINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SAME OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OR SINCE
2830-3980-0070 BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LOT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK WERE MERIT WE CAN DISMISS IN
2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MAN ARE SOLD ANDDERSON
2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SAD IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES INTO GOD WITH GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BITTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WOODS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM IS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO FACEOLOGY HE CONFESSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AN OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TEMYUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0002 IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEW PLATTANISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNEXIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CORRECT CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE IN CONNECT ABSTRACTION WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004 THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TEMIUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEOPLADMISTS
2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSIFER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE NEW PLATINISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATEO AND IN SPIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATEA WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALECTS OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF HIM BESIDES THE TWORILGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009 THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANYONE CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FINE THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AND ENTIRELY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011 WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE AN EX SAGROUS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MINE ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PITHICOREIANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN MATIMOUS
2961-960-0013 IT IS PROPER THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS VIICIOUS
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TENNIUS DIFFERED GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALECTS
2961-960-0016 BUT PLAINO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERRY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE FEATURES OR SUPPOSE HIM
2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN CONCEIVE THE BEAUTY OR ART OF INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FEEL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019 HE COULD RISE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TOMAIS OF PLATEO WHICH CHARACTERIZES TO PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIOUS
2961-960-0021 THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF COMPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLAY TO THOSE EARLIER WRITINGS
2961-960-0022 PLATETO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF OUR
2961-961-0000 SOMBREITIES BEGINS THE TO MEAS WITH A SUMERY OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEEK THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TO ME AS CITIZEN OF LOCRAS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER IN A STATESMAN AND TO YOU COURTEOUS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HER MOCRTIES WAS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
2961-961-0003 I WILL IF TO ME AS A PROVES I APPROVE
2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SO CRUTIES TO A TALE OF SILENCE WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER COURTEOUS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0005 SOME POEMS OF SILENCE WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POOR SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0007 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HAD DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE A FIENDIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008 THAT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
2961-961-0009 TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE'S SO ON HER THIS STORY
2961-961-0010 BUT IN EACH SHIP THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOREVER IN OUR TEMPLES
2961-961-0011 THE GENIALOLOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANIMALS SOLEMN ARE IN YOUR CHILDREN'S STORY
2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD AFENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DEAD THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER DEFACE OF HEAVEN
2961-961-0013 SULLEN MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE HE LAUGHED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUND IT OURS AS OUR ANIMALSS RECORD
2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXISTING ALL THIS WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0016 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND I SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED LEGISLATURES
2961-961-0017 OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARED THE LOTTOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLIING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN
2961-961-0018 THE MOST FAMEOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF A TRANTUS
2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE UTTER ALLINGS HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC MOTION
2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT HIS TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
2961-961-0022 THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TO MEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED IN SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCED THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST P THEEIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE
3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT POINT AND ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR AND STATING THE EMERGANCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS CELEBRATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILIIVE CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVITIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS THROUGH THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0003 WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE AND CULTURE THIS TABOOM MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOO OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONGED TO THE PLEASURE CLASS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MOPETIC CLEARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
3570-5694-0006 DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANCE THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME UNNERIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATESS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY DAY SPEECH AS A SYNNAUM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE HIS CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMOR HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MONSTER
3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FAILED TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONCEIVE ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF CAUSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARFRANALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CANVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATENT DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0012 THERE IS A MORALISTS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AND GRATES
3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHER THAT BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THESE A FILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME SPECIMEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM MUST SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RIGHTED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMES
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGRS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE COST AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LIST DEGREE HAVING TURNED ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIFES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS A LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR ESPENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVICE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0019 BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLUCKED
3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS A NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCUTRMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED A SUSPENSIBLY PREEDITARY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO BE DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIME LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED ON A BRIEF CHARACTER
3570-5694-0022 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO BEAR IT
3570-5695-0000 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY IN NO CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS CO INCIGHT
3570-5695-0001 THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMALLY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LOST
3570-5695-0002 BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTY OF THY CARE'S LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOW INVALID CLASS
3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTIFUL COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORALIST FOR TWO TO CIRCUMSTANCES IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF VOCED EFFORT
3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS THERACTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLIPS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY SEIZED TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0006 VERY MUCH OF SQUALLER AND DISCOMFIT WILL BE INDOED BEFORE THE LAST DRINK IT OR THE LOST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCYS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS IN NO COUNTRY THAT AS YIELDED SO OBDICTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
3570-5695-0008 THE QUESTION THIS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT
3570-5695-0009 EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROVE
3570-5695-0010 THE MOTHERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPECOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SOBILATIVE CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MABABILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGE OF ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0014 AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACES TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF ARAB GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
3570-5695-0015 THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENINGLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME MEASURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK FERRA MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE CROSS EYE PEACEFUL CULTURE
3570-5696-0002 ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCE PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSEDS MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS AFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MEN AN INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPACIOUS OBJECT OF EMULURATION AND BUDED IN THEIR OFFICIAL SILENT TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALK IS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0004 THE SALEN FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SAD IS HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REVOLUTION OF CONSPECIOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOOD SORROW OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUM IS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0006 AS USE IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTON OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSTUMOR UNDER THIS CANNON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0008 BUT IT IS ANOTHER GROUND'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT DIS CHARACTERS LESS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009 IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPECUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INDIVIDUAL PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0010 AN ARTICAL MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS CITILITY TO THE CONCURRE MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
3575-170457-0001 WHY WERE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER SOCIETY
3575-170457-0002 WHY ARE WE TO BE DEVOTED
3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE WERE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR AND IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004 WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND ORIGIN
3575-170457-0005 SHEITORIAN CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE A VIOLENT DESCENT AND RADICALISM
3575-170457-0006 HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE EVERYONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YORK CHURCH
3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO OF A LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONOURED
3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SYVA
3575-170457-0010 I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE LINES IT IS NOT RARE
3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CAN SALT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PEARL IN IT FOR HER
3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LAST LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND RECREATION
