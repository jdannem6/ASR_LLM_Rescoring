237-134493-0016 ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE YOU REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL OSAGE ORON HEDGES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0017 ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDER BUTRGSON
237-134493-0018 THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEHIVES ON THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES
237-134500-0000 FRANK READ ENGLISH STOUTLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGERIER HE GREW
237-134500-0001 MURRY SIGHED
237-134500-0002 A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRAWING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0003 THE ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SAND
237-134500-0004 THAT INVITATION DIVIDED HER

237-134500-0011 AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOKED AT THE SPIDERWBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
237-134500-0012 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHARIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SIGH WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN
237-134500-0013 LOUISE PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING RANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0014 AND EAMEL MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN GIBATA AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
237-134500-0016 I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW THEN ONES ARE
237-134500-0017 IF I FEEL THAT DAY I FEEL THAT WAY
237-134500-0018 HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INCIPID FRUIT LONG IVORY COLORED BERRIES TIPPED WITH MATE PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
237-134500-0019 HE DROPPED A HANDAL INTO HER LAP

237-134500-0022 WHEN SHE IS TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
237-134500-0023 IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH QUARREL
237-134500-0024 I LIKE TO TALK TO TOMORROW ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE

237-134500-0029 I DON'T WANT TO STAND AROUND BUT GONE
237-134500-0030 I' WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
237-134500-0031 SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLELOTH
237-134500-0032 THEY GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN

237-134500-0040 I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAY YOURSELF
237-134500-0041 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WONT PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
237-134500-0042 THAN ALL ARE GOOD TIMES ARE OVER
260-123286-0000 SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND NO LANDING SIGHT
260-123286-0001 THE HORIZON SEEMS EXACTLY DISTANT
260-123286-0002 ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELINGS OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE JESUS
260-123286-0004 ONE MIGHT BE WITHOUT LESS REASON THAN NOW
260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEAT IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0006 WE ARE LIVING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT
260-123286-0007 HE CALLED THE SEAUPON AND OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
260-123286-0008 THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VALUES AND PROSPECTS
260-123286-0009 I TAKE THIS IS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVING THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0010 SUNDAY SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH
260-123286-0011 NOTHING NEW WHETHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHENS
260-123286-0012 BUT THERE IS NO REASON OF FEAR
260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0014 TRULY THE SEE IS OF INFINITE WIDTH
260-123286-0015 IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANENAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY IN MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SLEEP
260-123286-0017 I SHUDDER AS I RECALLD THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HAMBURED MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0019 I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS BUT AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICK HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE
260-123286-0020 TUESDAY SUNDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH
260-123286-0021 DURING HIS WATCH EYES SLEPT
260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARD A TERRIBLE SHOCK AWAIT ME
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVE'D UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
260-123286-0024 THERE'S A WAY WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR
260-123286-0025 FIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTELS ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESSED TRADES
260-123286-0026 TWO MONSTERS ONLY RECRATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
260-123286-0027 I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF ICHTHE SOURCE GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COE AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
260-123286-0028 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING AND NATURALIST IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
260-123286-0029 THOSE HUGE FEATURES ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
260-123286-0030 SUDDENLY THE ICHTHEASORUS AND THE PLUSIOUS SOURCE DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WARPOLE EDDYING IN THE WATER
260-123286-0031 AS FOR THE ITHEASORUS HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMERIN CABURN
260-123288-0000 THE ROLLINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
260-123288-0001 THE WEATHER IF WE SHALL USE THE TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATIONS OF SAILING WATERS
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE TO THE DANCE COLONEL WHICH IS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004 THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS COLD
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEASY TUFT OF MISS WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GRAY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AND A PENNETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0006 THE ATMOSPHERE HAS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SEARCH CHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
260-123288-0007 THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASE STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
260-123288-0008 THEY'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
260-123288-0009 THOSE CLOUDS CAME AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMENT SAINT ELBOW'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LAD
260-123288-0011 BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE GET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0012 THAT WILL BE THE SAYST NO NO NEVER
260-123288-0013 THE PILEED UP VAPOURS CONTENTS IN THE WATER AND THE AIR PUT IN THE VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MIST ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0014 HON STIR'S NIGHT
260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL A MISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT THE ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLLICULES THE GASIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSHED UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0016 I REFER TO THE THESMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
260-123288-0017 IS THE ATMOSPHERE CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED A INTENSITY TO BECOME FINAL
260-123288-0018 THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EASTER
260-123288-0019 AT NOON THE VIOLENCEE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
260-123288-0020 EACH OF US IS FLASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
260-123288-0021 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE US HEADS
260-123288-0022 THEY SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I M NOT SURE
260-123288-0023 HE GNAWS HIS CONSENT
260-123288-0024 THE FIRE BALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SOLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN EXCESS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT DOWN AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBBLING LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HAUNTS WHO FIXS HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NEIGHBORHOOD FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS
260-123288-0028 WE SUFFER STIFLED PAINS
260-123440-0000 AND HOW BAD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
260-123440-0001 COURT ALICE
260-123440-0002 IT WAS THE WHITE RAPIDLY RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS
260-123440-0003 OH WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WALKING
260-123440-0004 ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIMES SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
260-123440-0005 AND YESTERDAY THANKS WAIT ON JUST AS USUAL
260-123440-0006 I'LL WOULD IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
260-123440-0007 I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING OLD LITTLE DIFFERENT
260-123440-0008 I'LL DRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT DATE
260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS JAWS AND WELCOMED LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
260-123440-0011 NO I'LL MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
260-123440-0012 IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN DEER
260-123440-0013 I' AM SO VERY TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE
260-123440-0014 AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BIG THAT IT IS
260-123440-0015 I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWIMB ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING CHARMED IN MY OWN TEARS
260-123440-0017 THAT WILL WE'LL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE
260-123440-0018 I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OH ELSE
260-123440-0019 CRIED ELLISON AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
260-123440-0020 WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D BROTHERS NOT WE INDEED
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF SUTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM MIND HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER AN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY UNGOATIONS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT SOMETIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0004 IT WAS WRITTEN IN LAUGHING
2830-3979-0005 THE WORK HAD TO BE CONNED
2830-3979-0006 A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTORY ANGLEATIONS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD PUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MIGALATIONS FOR INSTANCE AND
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GUATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF PRICE MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTUREES IS THERE
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOT T
2830-3979-0012 THE WORST OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SAW TO UNDERMON THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE LADIES YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LESS TO TURN TO CHRIST
2830-3980-0003 PARK CAME LATER IN HIS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CRIES FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISONNE HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY IN MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF THE GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXULT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 PULSE TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 PALE AND APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS IN APOSTLES
2830-3980-0011 PAUL DECLAREDS THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM AS THAT THEY WERE SIMPLE BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONS THE APOSTS FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014 THE HALL WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015 FOR PERSON THAT POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016 IT BOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINSTRY
2830-3980-0019 I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SO STRING INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SIMPLE PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021 THEN GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022 THE CAUS SEEMED SUPERVALOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTORS OF THE RIGHTLESSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE PENCIL PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CRIES WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 THE FIRST TWO
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BRETHREROOM WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOUTH TO THE FALSE APPPOSTLES
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT A PUZZLES LIKE MYSELF YET THERE ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACH AS I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE MARTIANS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES IN PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE THEM BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HATH NOT SEEN NOR HEAR HERD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE RELATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034 THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTOMINATED
2830-3980-0035 THEY WILL REMAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTECRIZED REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0038 GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD TO FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE CHARMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE GREETING OF THE APOSTTLE IS REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041 GRACE INVOLVES THE REMITION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD GRANTS THIS OF PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVESNESS
2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRACE ANDPIECE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045 MANY SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT KNOWN ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049 IMPRESSE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY IN THE TRUTH IN THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNDER THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARGUMENT ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CRIES WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS ARE CREED THAT PRICE IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL SCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER DOES DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE COULD CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PEACE SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THE ORANCE TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MAMMA ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059 CONSEIL STICKS TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060 HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS A PENCIL
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASSION LAMPS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR ARE GOODNESS BEFORE OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063 UNDER SHORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064 HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMITTION OF OUR SINS
2830-3980-0065 PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO HAS NAME JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINCE
2830-3980-0066 SAINT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THE SENTENCE ALSO TO FINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SUMMER OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0070 BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MADE LIGHT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK WHERE MERIT WE CAN DISMISS IN
2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN THEIRS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MAN ARE SOLD ANDERSON
2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SUN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES INTO GOD WITH GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND CONTINUALLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCEING COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM IN SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSICALOLOGY HE REFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AN OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TEMIS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0002 IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEW PLATANISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNEXIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUIET AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATEO
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CORRECT CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALISE IN CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004 THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TEMIUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEROPLADMISTS
2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE TRIBUTEED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE NEW PLATNISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLAYEDO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATEA WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALECTS OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF HIM BESIDES THE TWO TRILGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009 THE DIALEGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FINE THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN PIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011 WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE AN EXAGROUS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PITHICOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN DETIMINOUS
2961-960-0013 IT IS PROBLEM THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS VICIOUS
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TENNIUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALECTS
2961-960-0016 BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERRY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE FEATURES OR SUPPOSE HIM
2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS CUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FULFIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019 HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER THE GREAT LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TOMAUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES TO PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIOUS
2961-960-0021 THERE IS A ONE OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF OPPOSITION IN MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLAY TO THOSE EARLIER WRITINGS
2961-960-0022 PLANTO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF OUR
2961-961-0000 SORORITIES BEGINS THE TO MEAS WITH A SUMERY OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTIONLESS HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TO ME AS CITIZEN OF LOCRAS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER IN A STATESMAN AND TO YOU COURTEOUS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HER MACRTIES WHOSE ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
2961-961-0003 I WILL IF TO ME AS APPROVE I APPROVE
2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SOCRITIES TO A TALE OF SILENCE WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER COURTEOUS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0005 SIMPLE POEMS OF SOLEMN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POOH SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0007 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HAD DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE A THEMIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008 BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTERS
2961-961-0009 TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE'S ALLEN HEARD THIS STORY
2961-961-0010 BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US LEGISLATURE FOREVER IN OUR TEMPLES
2961-961-0011 THE GENIALLOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANIMALS SOLEMN ARE AM YOUR CHILDREN'S STORY
2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD AFINGS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DEAD THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER DEFACE OF HEAVEN
2961-961-0013 SOLEMN MARVELED AND DESIRED TO BEING FORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE HE LAUGHED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUND IT OURS AS OUR ANIMALS REQUIRED
2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG THIS WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLD AND TIME
2961-961-0016 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND I SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGICHESTERS
2961-961-0017 OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CURED THE LOGOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN
2961-961-0018 THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF A TANTAS
2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE UTTER CANNONS HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FELT IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT AT A TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
2961-961-0022 THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TO MEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED IN SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCED THEM TO YOU AS THE LEAST THEEIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE
3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT POINT AND ECONOMIC REVOLUTION FAR AND STATING THE EMERGEANCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS CELEBRATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE COST AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION ERECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0003 WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE AND CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORATICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOO OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS CENTURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MOPTIC CLEARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
3570-5694-0006 DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANCE THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME UNNERIFIC AS BEING A MOCK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATES OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNNAUM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE HIS CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARICAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELL TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONCEIVE ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MONSTERS
3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF CAUSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARFINEALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF UNVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0012 THERE IS A MORALIST ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANKING GRATES
3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHER THAT BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTLEITY
3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THESE A FILIATED GENTLEMAN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME SPECIMEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM MUST SCARCE YET ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMES
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CAST AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVING TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICAR'S CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIFES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS A LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL ORASTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE RICHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SURVIVAL OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0019 BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKD
3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS A NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED A SUSTENSIBLY PREDITARY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO BE DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMEAL LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED ON A PERFECT CHARACTER
3570-5694-0022 THE LIVEDRY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
3570-5695-0000 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY IN NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS CO IN SIGHT
3570-5695-0001 THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST ELEGANTED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5695-0002 BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTY IS OF I CARE'S LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION GIVE ALL UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOW AND MIDDLE CLASS
3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTIFUL COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORALLESS FOR TWO TO CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF VOICEED EFFORT
3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS THERICTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLIMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY SEIZED TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0006 VERY MUCH OF SQUIRE AND DISCOMFIT WILL BE INDOED BEFORE THE LAST DRINK IT OR THE LOST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCYS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS ON NO COUNTRY THAT IS YIELDED SO ABDICTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
3570-5695-0008 THE QUESTION US WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT
3570-5695-0009 EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGE OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0010 THE MUDON ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPECUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH PLEASURE
3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SOBILATIVE CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGE AT ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0014 AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACES TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF DAVID GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
3570-5695-0015 THE RESULT IS A GREAT ABILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY AMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK FAR MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE COURSE EYE PEACEFUL CULTURE
3570-5696-0002 OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS AFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MEN AN INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPACIOUS OBJECT OF EMULURATION AND BUDDED IN THEIR OFFICIAL SILENT TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALK IS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0004 THE SALAND FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SADS HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REVOLUTION OF CONSPECUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOOD SORT OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUM IS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0006 AS USE IN THE SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDER TONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOLD BY THE CONSTUMER UNDER THIS CANNON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0008 BUT IT IS ANOTHER GROUND'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT DIS CHARACTERS THUS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009 IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPECIOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVADOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0010 AN ARTICAL MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS CUTILITY TO THE CONCURRE MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MAID BUT FOR ETERNITY
3575-170457-0001 WHERE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
3575-170457-0002 WHAT ARE WE TO BE DIVIDED
3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR AN IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004 WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS IN RELIGION
3575-170457-0005 SHE YETORIAN CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE A VIOLENT DESCENT AND RADICALISM
3575-170457-0006 HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE CAN NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YORK CHEER
3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO WITH A LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONOURED
3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SYL THE
3575-170457-0010 I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT WEAR
3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CAN CONSULT YOUR UNHAPPINESS
3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A PASSION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LAST LEISURE WILL SHE HAPPEN FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
