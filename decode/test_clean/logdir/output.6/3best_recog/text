5683-32866-0015 WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT
5683-32866-0016 MARKED MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU I AND TOO DEEP
5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN HELP IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FEWS
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MILD MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND THE SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT EDGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNEXPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
5683-32866-0022 ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FEATED TAPESTRY
5683-32866-0023 ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGING TO OTHER TIMES
5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN THE GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTILY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
5683-32866-0025 I DID NOT EVEN TAKE A PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
5683-32866-0026 I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY TRIBUTE
5683-32866-0027 A CALLED BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC VERSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029 SOMEHOW I HAD GROWING NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED ON THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY

5683-32879-0001 WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD A BAD NIGHT
5683-32879-0002 SO THERE CAME A STEP AND THE LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF WELCOME
5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TWO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL JEALOUS
5683-32879-0004 BUT POOR RACHEL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOCAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
5683-32879-0005 THIS TRANSIT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGILING OUR SENSES
5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED TO THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORM HERSELF
5683-32879-0007 RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DISLATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE
5683-32879-0008 YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY DEAR RACHEL
5683-32879-0009 ILL AND TROUBLE DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISSERABLY NERVOUS
5683-32879-0010 POOR CREATURE HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS SHE DARED
5683-32879-0011 SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTTOOK A FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
5683-32879-0012 TAKE YOU RACHEL MY COUSIN RACHEL MY ONLY FRIEND

672-122797-0002 HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SUN AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND PADDLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERRIES
672-122797-0003 BUT THIS WAS THAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
672-122797-0004 IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLIMMERING ON THE GROUND A HARE WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE

672-122797-0024 THE PROPRIETOR WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
672-122797-0025 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HURT A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
672-122797-0026 THERE TWO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WITH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
672-122797-0027 THE SERVANT AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED IT

672-122797-0041 IN THE MORNING THE SERVANTS THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN
672-122797-0042 BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
672-122797-0043 WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THESE THOUGHT THE TREE
672-122797-0044 AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE LAW LOST IN REVERY
672-122797-0045 TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN THE CORNER OUT OF THE WAY

672-122797-0070 THE GOLDEN STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF A TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
672-122797-0071 IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MARRIED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIRST TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
672-122797-0072 AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAT LYING THERE
672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BROOING COPPER AND ITS SIDE SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY THAT AN END
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAIN FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGER'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORTUNE A JACK
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT NIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVE AN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FRENCH CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DAT OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIR VIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY TRAIL
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN A LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0010 WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TOP
6829-68769-0011 I AM RENTING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
6829-68769-0012 I'LL SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING AS DEMEANOR
6829-68769-0013 MAYBE SEA DATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG THE SUCCESSION OF PASSENGERS
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNIN FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DIE IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED YOUR'S VISITORS TOM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM WORSE AN AIR REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0018 MISTER GRAPH SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0019 SORRY WE HAVE N'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID BATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A PENSION
6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WITH TOM GATES WITH STEADY GRAY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOU STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO THANK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL WAS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0025 THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEADER HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NEARER CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHECK ASKED KNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS DISPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A STOPPED COMPANY AND RICH
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BIT KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORCH THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS BY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLATE BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHLL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT IM GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCKE THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MIGHT DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND IT ROMES A MAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRL HAS BEEN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I'M NOT ELECTION DURING JUST NOW
6829-68769-0042 OH WELL SERVE WHAT ABOUT HIM
6829-68769-0043 AND HE DESERVES THE TURN IN STATES PRISON
6829-68769-0044 IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS AND ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE CAUSE BESIDE
6829-68769-0046 YOURE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHLL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORD CHECK AND WASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GAITS
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASINESS SILENCE NUDGED HIM
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF MOVEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGE CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY IN DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORWARDS AGRESS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMAN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVAS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WEAK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHEND AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT THE WAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS RENOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH RENALDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THEBUGGY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL GREEK WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN COLLECTING MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM HIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIR VIEW BOUND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESS
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSEQUENT REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANTS WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEN GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENTIONS BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF ARTHUR CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER A SPECIAL FAVORITE
6829-68771-0017 THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BOTH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPASURE AND OF SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MATES AT ELMHURST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LOT AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PARSONS
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE PROTESTED A GIRL
6829-68771-0022 I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MANDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE ARE YOUR HOME
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE REFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
6829-68771-0026 ELIZA PARSON S SHOOK HER HEAD
6829-68771-0027 THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AM MUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELICA SURPASSED HER A NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTED BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MATE'S HANDS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES IN FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH YOUR BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I WISHED I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO WAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LUCK
6930-75918-0000 CONQUERORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FOLDED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WOULD POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED IN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVE AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPEN FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAIN THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN AN HARSSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS IS
6930-75918-0008 CAN YOU IMAGINE MY BUCCANEER HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU WHERE MISTAKEN RALPH I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0010 I CAN PERCEIVE LOVED CLEARLY ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAYS THE COUNT
6930-75918-0012 IT IS ANNOYANCE THAT
6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VERY TIMES I EVEN HAD IT MORE
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED ROWE NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
