5683-32866-0015 BUT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
5683-32866-0016 MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU I CAN TOO DEEP
5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT AT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FUGUES
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MENTAL MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND THE SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE OWEED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNACCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY VAN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
5683-32866-0022 ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FATED TAPESTRY
5683-32866-0023 ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGS TO OTHER TIMES
5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS AND FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN THE GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
5683-32866-0025 I DID NOT EVEN MAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
5683-32866-0026 I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY ROOT
5683-32866-0027 A GOLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC PARSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029 SOMEHOW I HAVE GROWN NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
5683-32879-0000 IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDAN DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMANN'S FARM
5683-32879-0001 WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD THE BAD NIGHT
5683-32879-0002 SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININING DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF WELCOME
5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WEMEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL JEALOUS
5683-32879-0004 BUT POOR RACHEL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOTHICAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
5683-32879-0005 THIS TRANSIT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGUISING OUR SENSES
5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEAR TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMER SELF
5683-32879-0007 RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYE STUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE
5683-32879-0008 YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR ROLLIN
5683-32879-0009 ILL AND TROUBLELED DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
5683-32879-0010 POOR REACHED ALL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS SHE DARED
5683-32879-0011 SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK THE FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
5683-32879-0012 THANK ME RACHEL MY COUSIN RACHEL MY ONLY FRIEND

672-122797-0024 THE DEPARTURE WAS WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
672-122797-0025 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MEN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
672-122797-0026 THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WITH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO

672-122797-0041 IN THE MORNING THE SERMON AND THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN
672-122797-0042 BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IT A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
672-122797-0043 WHATEVER'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE

672-122797-0045 TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST NOBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY

672-122797-0072 AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE IS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE
672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGEREWING COPPER AND ITS SIDE SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE DAWN THE STORY AT AN END
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAIN FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGER'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FOR FORTUNE A CHECK
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM STATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATES PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYERER
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVED AN A GAZE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO ACCOUNT THE COST
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORT CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DEAL OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIR VIEWS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY DRAIL
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MANINE MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER

6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HE'S VISITORS TOM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM WORSE IN ERROR REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY

6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORIES SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOPPED TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD OUR ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0025 THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LATER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE GENTLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE JACK ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHICKS OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A STOCK COMPANY IN RICH
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BIT KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHEQUE AND FORCH THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBBERING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHAL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNBEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHAL SAID KENNETH IN DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT IT'M GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT HIM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS O THAT KIND IN MY DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND HE RUINS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIVELY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRLS HAS BEEN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I'M NOT ELECTIONARYING JUST NOW
6829-68769-0042 OH WELL ER WHAT ABOUT HIM
6829-68769-0043 AND HE DESERVES THE TERM AND STATES PRISON
6829-68769-0044 IT HAS COST ME TWICE SAFETY DOLLARS AN ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE CAUSES BESIDES
6829-68769-0046 YOU WERE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHIL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHEQUE FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGE CHECK AND WASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASY YET A SILENCE NUDGED HIM
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHIRT FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED JOKE FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THE MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE AT THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORTS AGRESS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMENT AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL COUNTESS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WE NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATTIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS RENALS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH RUNNNALDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHERE KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUGGY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE SLAUGHTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WILLING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIR VIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESSS
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND THE DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESS
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANTS WAS EXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTEMPTS BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE AIDS
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER AS SPECIAL FAVORITE
6829-68771-0017 THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE AWAY AND BETH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND OF SLIGHTLY SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULARION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAYING BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LOT AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I AM ELIZABETH PARSONS
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE PROTESTED THE GIRLS
6829-68771-0022 I INTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS YO HOME
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE SPACE OF HER VISITOR
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP RUSHED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
6829-68771-0026 ELASA PARSON SHOOK HER HEAD
6829-68771-0027 THEY' THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEN MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FARM YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER A NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ABSURDIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES WONDERFUL TO THE MAID'S HANDS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORMER MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED SCARCELY
6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAKE TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOOK
6930-75918-0000 CONJORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FOOTED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN ON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH ENHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITFULLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPEN FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS FEET LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN AN HAIRSSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE FRIGHTENED WITH ME I ALWAYS AM
6930-75918-0008 CAN YOUR IMAGINE MY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU HOW MISTAKEN ROW I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0010 I CAN PERCEIVE LOVE CLEAR ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE ACCOUNT
6930-75918-0012 IT IT IS ANNOYANCE THEN
6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN HAD BEEN MORE
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED ROUTE NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AN INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
