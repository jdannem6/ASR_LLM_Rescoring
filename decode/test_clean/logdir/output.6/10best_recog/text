5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FEUGUES
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUNT MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND THE SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGENT OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNEXPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY VAIN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN

672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BRREWING COPPER AND ITS SIGHED SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY MADE AN END
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAIN FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGER'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PETALTY FOR FORTUNE A CHECK
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRY INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATES PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT SIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVED A GAZE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID WETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORCH CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I STATE OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIRVIWS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY DRAIL
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE SAVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0010 WE WISH TO TALK OF HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TALK
6829-68769-0011 I'M RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN PICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
6829-68769-0012 I'LL SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING AS DEMEANOUR
6829-68769-0013 MAYBE YOU SEE DATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG THE SECTION OF PASSAGES
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR AS SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DYING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND HELD HERE'S VISITORS TOM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM HORSES AN ERROR REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0018 MISTER GRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICEING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0019 SORRY I HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID KEATS IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A PENSION
6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GRAY EYES AND INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTING IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T START TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGER'S HAD HER ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0025 THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEADER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RAK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW SEA IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN THE CHECK ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SCIENCE ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A TALK COMPANY AND RICH
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BIT KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I RECEIVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEELING THAN TO NO THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH IN DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT I'M DREADFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO RELOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS O THAT KIND IN THAT DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND IT ROLLINS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRL HAS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO REVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I'M NOT ELECTION NEARING JUST NOW
6829-68769-0042 OH WELL SAY WHAT ABOUT HIM
6829-68769-0043 AND HE DISTURBS THE TERM IN STATES PRISON
6829-68769-0044 IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS ANY ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE CALLS BESIDES
6829-68769-0046 HE'RE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHAAL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGE CHECK AND CROSS FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GAINS
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE NUDGEED HIM
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SWEET FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HED BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVED ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORDS AGRESS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMENT AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVAS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WEEK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM THE OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT AWAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNALDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH RUNALDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE GUGGY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMAN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING THE MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WALK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIR VIEWAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUFFICIENT REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MEN WHERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESS
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANTS WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREATER SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE INTENDANCE BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF NORTH CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS HER MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER SPECIAL FAVORITE
6829-68771-0017 THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BYTH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STEERING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND OF SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE SPECULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAYING BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE HAT AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PERSONS
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE CONTESTED THE GIRL
6829-68771-0022 I ATTEMPT TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS HER HOME
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER EYES WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCK SLOWLY BACK AND FOURTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
6829-68771-0026 ELZA PARSON SHOOK HER HEAD
6829-68771-0027 THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMISED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0029 BENETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER A NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER WON OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAIDEN'S HANDS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FIRM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE AROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I WILL WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OLD ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAB AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
6930-75918-0000 CONICORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FOLLOWEDED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS ANYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH AND HAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FEATURE OPENED FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS ARMS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN AN CARESSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS BE
6930-75918-0008 CAN YOU IMAGINE WHY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU HAVE MISTAKEN ROW I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0010 I COULD PERCEIVE LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 I BE CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNT
6930-75918-0012 IT WAS ANNOYANCE THEN
6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VERY DREAMS I EVEN HAD IT MORE
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED ROUTE NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
