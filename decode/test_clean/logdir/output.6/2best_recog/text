5683-32866-0015 WHAT I SAY IS TOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
5683-32866-0016 MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU I AM TOO DEEP
5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CANT HELP IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FOODS
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTH AND MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND THE SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN EVERYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNACCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
5683-32866-0022 ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FEED TAPESTRY
5683-32866-0023 ALL THE FURNITURE BELONG TO OTHER TIMES
5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
5683-32866-0025 I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKEING UP THE CHIMNEY
5683-32866-0026 I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY THROAT
5683-32866-0027 A COLD BRIGHT MOON WERE SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HEARSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029 SOMEHOW I HAD GROW NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
5683-32879-0000 IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PASSED ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDAN DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMAN'S FARM
5683-32879-0001 WHILE SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT
5683-32879-0002 SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPEN AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF WELCOME
5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL PALACE
5683-32879-0004 BUT POOR RACHEL LINK HAD MORE THAN THAT STOICAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
5683-32879-0005 THIS TRANSIT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGUILEING OUR SENSES
5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMER SELF
5683-32879-0007 RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH THE PAINFUL SURPRISE
5683-32879-0008 YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR CREATURE
5683-32879-0009 ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
5683-32879-0010 POOR RACHEL HER NATURE RE COILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS SHE DARED
5683-32879-0011 SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
5683-32879-0012 THINK YOU RACHEL MY COUSIN RACHEL MY ONLY FRIEND

672-122797-0002 HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SUN AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND CRACKLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERRIES
672-122797-0003 BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT DARE TO HEAR
672-122797-0004 IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HAIR WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE

672-122797-0023 HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS ROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS
672-122797-0024 A DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
672-122797-0025 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDOR WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
672-122797-0026 THERE TWO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WHERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
672-122797-0027 THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DEGRADED IT

672-122797-0040 IN THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
672-122797-0041 IN THE MORNING THE SERVANTS AND THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN
672-122797-0042 BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM WENT UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
672-122797-0043 WHAT'S THE MEAN OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE
672-122797-0044 AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE
672-122797-0045 TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TWO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY

672-122797-0068 BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT
672-122797-0069 IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEDS AND NETTLES
672-122797-0070 THE GOLD AND STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
672-122797-0071 IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MARRIED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
672-122797-0072 AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A HOLE HEAP LYING THERE
672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BRREWING COPPER AND ITS SIDE SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY HAD AN END
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAIN FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORTUNE A CHECK
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM BATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATES PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD WARRIOR
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT THE GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVED A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SELF HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORTUNE CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIR VIEWS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY TRAIL
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAME MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0010 WE WISHED TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TALK
6829-68769-0011 I'M RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
6829-68769-0012 I'LL SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING HIS DEMEATOR
6829-68769-0013 MAYBE SEE DATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DYING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HEAR'S VISITORS TOM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM WORSE THAN ERROR REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0018 MISTER GRATH SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0019 SORRY IT WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A PENSIONER
6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GREY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND IM GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR IN HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0025 THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN TO THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHEQUE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERT
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A STOP COMPANY AND RICH
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BIT KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHEQUE AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOST ONE DAY
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLATE BUT MARSHAL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UN FEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT I'M GRATEFUL TO FINE A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN THAT DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND IT ROMANS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUS SLEEP BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRLS HAS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I'M NOT ELECTION ARRANGEDS NOW
6829-68769-0042 OH WELL SURE WHAT ABOUT HIM
6829-68769-0043 AND HE DESERVES A TERM IN STATES PRISON
6829-68769-0044 IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS IN ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE COST BESIDES
6829-68769-0046 YOU ARE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHAL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGE CHECK AND CRUSH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE NUDGED HIM
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMAZEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHUCK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAINMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE AT THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORDS AGRESS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMENT AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVAS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WEEK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURE'D OUT A WAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS RENALDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ILL ELECT HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH RONALDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMEN IN THE BUGGY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLUTTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO AFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIR VIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBOURS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESS
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENDANTS BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MATES
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER SPECIAL FAVOURITE
6829-68771-0017 THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BACK FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAYING BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAD AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PARSONS
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE PROTECTED THE GIRL
6829-68771-0022 I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD BENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE'S YOUR HOME
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAIDEN SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP WALKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
6829-68771-0026 ELIZA PARSONS SHOOK HER HEAD
6829-68771-0027 THEY THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEMED WILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SUPPRESSED HER A NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL PREED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES WONDERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FEAR MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH A BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I WISH I KNOW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035 WHERE YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLUM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
6930-75918-0000 CONCORD RETURN TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FOADED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGIVE FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST A PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN AN HARASSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE RANK WITH ME I ALWAYS AM
6930-75918-0008 CAN YOU IMAGINE MY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO SILENT I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU ARE MISTAKEN RALPH I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0010 I CAN PERCEIVED LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 I IS CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNT
6930-75918-0012 IT IS A ANNOYANCE THEN
6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN HADED MORE
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED RAWE NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AN INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
