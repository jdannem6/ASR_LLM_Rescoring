8224-274381-0013 FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENCE COULD RELY ON
8224-274381-0014 BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND THEN WARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
8224-274381-0015 THAT THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
8224-274381-0016 VALOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING
8224-274381-0017 HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS
8224-274384-0000 HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL
8224-274384-0001 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ONLY EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
8224-274384-0002 THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
8224-274384-0003 OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
8224-274384-0004 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
8224-274384-0005 ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER APPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS DISAPPOINTMENT OR DID THIS SUM TO BE SUNG
8224-274384-0006 THE KING STOOD UP AND COLD FOR THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
8224-274384-0007 HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
8224-274384-0008 THE GOOD NATURED ORD AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALL IN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE SONG WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR
8224-274384-0009 THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
8224-274384-0010 BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
8224-274384-0011 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEING PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTH AND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AND INTEREST TO DISCUSS
8224-274384-0012 IF ANY STILL RETAIN RANKER AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHES MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
8224-274384-0013 HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
8230-279154-0000 THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
8230-279154-0001 WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL COROLATES ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
8230-279154-0002 WHETHER NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT I DOES APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
8230-279154-0003 AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
8230-279154-0004 THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST
8230-279154-0005 ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TONABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
8230-279154-0006 THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
8230-279154-0007 HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIOUR IS FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
8230-279154-0008 BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN EFFORTENCE IS WARRANTED
8230-279154-0009 OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
8230-279154-0010 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRANCE FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
8230-279154-0011 SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FILL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
8230-279154-0012 FAMILIARITY IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
8230-279154-0013 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
8230-279154-0014 I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0015 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0016 IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
8230-279154-0017 THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
8230-279154-0018 THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0019 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0020 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
8230-279154-0021 REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
8230-279154-0022 SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
8230-279154-0023 IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
8230-279154-0024 THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0025 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS A MEDIACY
8230-279154-0026 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
8230-279154-0027 A CRIMINAL BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRANDIFONS AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
8230-279154-0028 I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
8230-279154-0029 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
8230-279154-0030 SYMEN'S TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
8230-279154-0031 THEY GIVE WALLS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
8230-279154-0032 IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
8230-279154-0033 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
8230-279154-0034 WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEAVES US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
8230-279154-0035 THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
8230-279154-0036 A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
8230-279154-0037 RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
8230-279154-0038 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
8230-279154-0039 THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
8230-279154-0040 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
8230-279154-0041 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LENGTHS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
8230-279154-0042 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLE OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
8230-279154-0043 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
8455-210777-0000 I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
8455-210777-0001 HAD EVEN CRESTWELLER NOT IN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL A COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNTON OVER REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BENNET AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRAGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
8455-210777-0002 ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
8455-210777-0003 AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
8455-210777-0004 I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISIN QUARTER OF THE WORLD
8455-210777-0005 WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE IS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WATER
8455-210777-0006 WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLEAX SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0007 QUITE SATISFIED SAID EVA
8455-210777-0008 THE LADIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED OR ON THE OTHER
8455-210777-0009 NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
8455-210777-0010 THEY ARE MASTER SAID MISSUS NEVER BEND
8455-210777-0011 I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTLELAX TO TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
8455-210777-0012 MISSUS NEVER BEEN YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
8455-210777-0013 JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
8455-210777-0014 SIR KENNTON OVAL IS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0015 I AM MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO CROSS WELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
8455-210777-0016 THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BE FIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
8455-210777-0017 MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMAN A VERY GOOD DINNER
8455-210777-0018 THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH THERE
8455-210777-0019 THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
8455-210777-0020 OH YES SAID JACK AN I'M NOWHERE
8455-210777-0021 BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONG
8455-210777-0022 OF WHAT MISSUS NEVER BEEN HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
8455-210777-0023 WE SAT WITH THE OFFICERS SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE
8455-210777-0024 HOW MUCH OF EVIL A REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
8455-210777-0025 WHAT COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
8455-210777-0026 AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMT COULD NOT ALAS
8455-210777-0027 WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF IN HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FURTHEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SECLUSION WHAT I END MY DAYS
8455-210777-0028 JACK WOULD BECOME EVEN'S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMISS THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
8455-210777-0029 THINK OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
8455-210777-0030 MISTER NEVER BEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVE THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
8455-210777-0031 YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STAND SO HIGH
8455-210777-0032 IT IS A DUTY SAID I
8455-210777-0033 BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
8455-210777-0034 NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TROUBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
8455-210777-0035 THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVER BEN SAID SIR FERDINAND BILL BROWN
8455-210777-0036 I CAN AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEEL THAT IN A MATTER OF WHICH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLD IS CONCERNED I OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUTE FORCE
8455-210777-0037 YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING US WITH ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION
8455-210777-0038 THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH A COURTESY DUE TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
8455-210777-0039 I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BOARD
8455-210777-0040 THEN SAID SIR FERDINANDO THERE'S NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT WE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
8455-210777-0041 THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELT
8455-210777-0042 YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDIN END O BROWN HA SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTLE AX
8455-210777-0043 BUT WHAT IS THE DELICATE MISSION I ASKED
8455-210777-0044 I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE AND MATTERED NOT WHICH
8455-210777-0045 THEN THE REPUBLIC OF BRITINULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON EXISTENT AND THE BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR INSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
8455-210777-0046 YOU MAY BE QUITE SHORT THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLE AXE AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD
8455-210777-0047 YOU PROPOSED TO KIT NOT ME I SAID
8455-210777-0048 WHAT WE BECOME OF YOUR GUN WERE I TO KIDNAP YOU
8455-210777-0049 LIEUTENANT CROSSTRIES IS A VERY GALLANT OFFICER
8455-210777-0050 ONE OF US ALWAYS REMAINS ON BOARD WHILE THE OTHER IS ON SHORE
8455-210777-0051 WHAT WORLD WIDE INIQUITY SUCH A SPEECH AS THAT DISCLOSES SAID I STILL TURNING MYSELF TO THE CAPTAIN FOR THOUGH I WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THEM BOTH BY MY WORDS HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE MY DISLIKE CENTERED ITSELF ON SIR FURTINANDO
8455-210777-0052 YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SUGGEST SAID HE BUT THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION
8455-210777-0053 WERE I TO COMPLY WITH YOUR ORDERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OWN OPINION I SHOULD SEEM TO HAVE DONE SO WILLINGLY HEREAFTER
8455-210777-0054 THE LETTER RAN AS FOLLOWS
8455-210777-0055 SIR I HAVE IT IN COMMAND TO INFORM YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF THE CROWN COLONY WHICH IS CALLED BRITINUA
8455-210777-0056 THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXCELLENCIES KNOWLEDGE
8455-210777-0057 BUT IN THEIR SELECTION OF A CONSTITUTION THE BRITAIN NEWISTS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY ALLOWED THEMSELVES BUT ONE DELIBERATE ASSEMBLY AND HENCE HAS SPRUNG THEIR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES
8455-210777-0058 IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE THAT PERIOD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASE TO WORK
8455-210777-0059 BUT IT IS SURPRISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR GOVERNOR
8455-210777-0060 THE JOHN BRIGHT IS ARM WITH A WEAPON OF GREAT POWER AGAINST WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN YELO SHOULD PREVAIL
8455-210777-0061 YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED MEN OF THE NORTH NORTHWEST BIRMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MISTER NEVER BEEN BE WITHDRAWN THE PEOPLE WILL REVERE EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEDIENCE
8455-210777-0062 WHEN DO YOU INTEND THAT THE JOHN RIGHT SHALL START
8455-210777-0063 TO DAY I SHOUTED
8455-210777-0064 AND I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCHIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT
8455-210777-0065 I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM SAID SIR FORRNANDO
8455-210777-0066 THEY OF COURSE MUST ALL BE ALTERED
8455-210777-0067 OR OF THE HABITS OF OUR PEOPLE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
8455-210777-0068 YOUR POWER IS SUFFICIENT I SAID
8455-210777-0069 IF YOU WILL GIVE US YOUR PROMISE TO MEET CAPTAIN ADDALAX HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW WE WILL STRETCH A POINT AND DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE JOHN BRIGHT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
8455-210777-0070 AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TOO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMISE THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE
8463-287645-0000 THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY WAS CONCERNED
8463-287645-0001 IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY MORE OF THEM HERE
8463-287645-0002 FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH REGARD TO ROBERT HOLLAND NO MAN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF HIS RECOLLECTIONS WILL BE LONGER REMEMBERED THAN HE HIS ENTHRAMENT WHILE UNDER HOLLAND WILL HARDLY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
8463-287645-0003 OF THIS PARTY EDWARD A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CALLED FORTH MUCH SYMPATHY HE TOO WAS CLAIMED BY HOLLAND
8463-287645-0004 JOHN WESLEY COMASH JACO TAYLOR AND THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER
8463-287645-0005 A FEW YEARS BACK ONE OF THEIR SLAVES A COACHMAN WAS KEPT ON THE COACH BOX ONE COLD NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE OUT AT A BALL UNTIL HE BECAME ALMOST FROZEN TO DEATH IN FACT HE DID DIE IN THE INFIRMARY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE FROST ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTERWARDS
8463-287645-0006 THE DOCTOR WHO ATTENDED THE INJURED CREATURE IN THIS CASE WAS SIMPLY TOLD THAT SHE SLIPPED AND FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AS SHE WAS COMING DOWN
8463-287645-0007 ANOTHER CASE SAID JOHN WESLEY WAS A LITTLE GIRL HALF GROWN WHO WAS WASHING WINDOWS UPSTAIRS ONE DAY AND UNLUCKILY FELL ASLEEP IN THE WINDOW AND IN THIS POSITION WAS FOUND BY HER MISTRESS IN A RAGE THE MISTRESS HIT HER A HEAVY SLAP KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SHE FELL TO THE PAVEMENT AND DIED IN A FEW HOURS FROM THE EFFECTS THEREOF
8463-287645-0008 AS USUAL NOTHING WAS DONE IN THE WAY OF PUNISHMENT
8463-287645-0009 I NEVER KNEW OF BUT ONE MAN WHO COULD EVER PLEASE HIM
8463-287645-0010 HE WORKED ME VERY HARD HE WANTED TO BE BEATING ME ALL THE TIME
8463-287645-0011 SHE WAS A LARGE HOMELY WOMAN THEY WERE COMMON WHITE PEOPLE WITH NO REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY
8463-287645-0012 SUBSTANTIALLY THIS WAS JACOB'S UN VARNISHED DESCRIPTION OF HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS
8463-287645-0013 AS TO HIS AGE AND ALSO THE NAME OF HIS MASTER JACO'S STATEMENT VARIED SOMEWHAT FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT
8463-287645-0014 OF STARTING I DIDN'T KNOW THE WAY TO COME
8463-294825-0000 IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURE
8463-294825-0001 THIS REALITY BEGINS TO EXPLAIN THE DARK POWER AND OTHER WORLDLY FASCINATION OF TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS
8463-294825-0002 FIRST AS A PARIS STOCK BROKER LATER AS A CELEBRATED AUTHOR AND YATSMAN HE WENT ON FREQUENT VOYAGES TO BRITAIN AMERICA THE MEDITERRANEAN
8463-294825-0003 NEMO BUILDS A FABULOUS FUTUREISTIC SUBMARINE THE NAUTILUS THEN CONDUCTS AN UNDERWATER CAMPAIGN OF VENGEANCE AGAINST HIS IMPERIALST OPPRESSOR
8463-294825-0004 IN ALL THE NOVEL HAD A DIFFICULT JUSTATION
8463-294825-0005 OTHER SUBTIES OCCUR INSIDE EACH EPISODE THE TEXTURES SPARKLING WITH WIT INFORMATION AND INSIGHT
8463-294825-0006 HIS SPECIFIC OCCASIONS FOR AN OPEN SEA SUBMARINE AND A SELF CONTAINING DIVING SUIT WERE DECADES BEFORE THEIR TIME YET MODERN TECHNOLOGY BEARS THEM OUT TRIUMPHANTLY
8463-294825-0007 EVEN THE SUPPORTING CAST IS SHREWDLY DRAWN PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAREER SCIENTIST CAUGHT IN AN ETHICAL CONFLICT CONSEIL THE COMPULSIVE CLASSIFIER WHO SUPPLIES HUMOROUS TAGLINES FOR VERN'S FAST FACTS THE HARPOONER NED LAND A CREATURE OF CONSTANT APPETITES MAN AS HEROIC ANIMAL
8463-294825-0008 BUT MUCH OF THE NOVELS BROODING POWER COMES FROM CAPTAIN NEMO
8463-294825-0009 THIS COMPULSION LEADS NEMO INTO UGLY CONTRADICTIONS HE IS A FIGHTER FOR FREEDOM YET ALL WHO BOARD HIS SHIP ARE IMPRISONED THERE FOR GOOD HE WORKS TO SAVE LIVES BOTH HUMAN AND ANIMAL YET HE HIMSELF CREATES A WHOLE COST HE DETESTS IMPERIALISM YET HE LAYS PERSONAL CLAIM TO THE SOUTH POLE
8463-294825-0010 AND IN THIS LAST ACTION HE FALLS INTO THE CLASSIC SIN OF PRIDE
8463-294825-0011 HE IS SWIFTLY PUNISHED
8463-294825-0012 THE NAUTILUS NEARLY PERISHES IN THE ANTARCTIC AND NEMO SINKS INTO A GROWING DEPRESSION
8463-294825-0013 FOR MANY THEN THIS BOOK HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF FASCINATION SURELY ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL NOVELS EVER WRITTEN AN INSPIRATION FOR SUCH SCIENTISTS AND DISCOVERERS AS ENGINEERS SIMON LAKE O SHOULDOGRAPHER WILLIAM B B POLAR TRAVELERS ARE EARNEST JACKLETON

8463-294828-0001 THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER I KNOW MORE DREAMED OF CHASING THE UNICORN THAN OF TRYING FOR THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE
8463-294828-0002 EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING A REST
8463-294828-0003 I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS
8463-294828-0004 BUT NOW NOTHING COULD HOLD ME BACK
8463-294828-0005 CONSEIL WAS MY MANSERVANT
8463-294828-0006 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO
8463-294828-0007 CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE DO NOTHING ELSE WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALEEN WHALE
8463-294828-0008 AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD
8463-294828-0009 NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THE LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF THE JOURNEY
8463-294828-0010 NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUIT CASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONGO NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS
8463-294828-0011 HE WENT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT
8463-294828-0012 PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANDED WAY OF ADMITTING THAT I HAD TURNED FORTY
8463-294828-0013 HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT HIGHERSOME
8463-294828-0014 THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONLESS MAN
8463-294828-0015 CONSEIL I CALLED A THIRD TIME CONSEIL APPEARED
8463-294828-0016 DEAD MASTER SUMMONED ME HE SAID ENTERING
8463-294828-0017 PACK AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELING KIT MY SUITS SHIRTS AND SOCKS DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN AND HURRY
8463-294828-0018 WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM LATER WHAT

8463-294828-0020 YES WE ARE CERTAINLY I REPLIED EVASIVELY BUT AFTER WE MAKE A DETOUR
8463-294828-0021 A ROUT SLIGHTLY LESS DIRECT THAT'S ALL
8463-294828-0022 WE'RE LEAVING ON THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
8463-294828-0023 YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE
8463-294828-0024 WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WILL TAKE US
8463-294828-0025 BUT WE'RE GOING JUST THE SAME
8463-294828-0026 WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHOSE GAME FOR ANYTHING
8463-294828-0027 I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING MY CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARIS FRANCE
8463-294828-0028 I OPENED A LINE OF CREDIT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE BARBARUSA AND CONSEIL AT MY HEELS I JUMPED INTO A CARRIAGE
8463-294828-0029 OUR BAGGAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED TO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE I RUSHED ABOARD
8463-294828-0030 I ASKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT
8463-294828-0031 ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTER DECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TO ME
8463-294828-0032 IN PERSON WELCOME A BOY PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU
8463-294828-0033 I WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY CABIN WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS
8463-294828-0034 WE'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE I TOLD CONSEIL
8463-294828-0035 AND SO IF I HAD BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON THIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM
8463-294828-0036 THE WHARVES OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS
8463-294828-0037 DEPARTING FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
8463-294828-0038 THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
8555-284447-0000 THEN HE RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE COURTYARD SHOUTING LOUDLY FOR HIS SOLDIERS AND THREATENING TO CATCH EVERYBODY IN HIS DOMINIONS THAT THE SAILORMAN WAS NOT RE CAPTURED
8555-284447-0001 HOLD HIM FAST MY MAN AND AS SOON AS I'VE HAD MY COFFEE IN A WILL I'LL TOOK HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND PATCH HIM
8555-284447-0002 I WOULDN'T MIND A COUPLE OF COFFEE MYSELF SAID CAMVILLE I'VE HAD CONSIDERABLE EXERCISE THIS MORNING AND I'M MORE READY FOR BREAKFAST
8555-284447-0003 BUT CAPTAIN BILL MADE NO SUCH ATTEMPT KNOWING IT WOULD BE USELESS
8555-284447-0004 AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE THE BULEROOM GAVE A YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT
8555-284447-0005 THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE WAS HIGH AND BIG AND AROUND IT RAN ROWS OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATORS TO SIT UPON
8555-284447-0006 IN ONE PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY WITH ELEGANT THRONE CHAIRS FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND SIX SMALLER BUT RICHLY A POSTERED CHAIRS FOR THE SNOW KNOWS PRINCESSES
8555-284447-0007 THEREFORE HER MAJESTY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANY ONE AND NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
8555-284447-0008 RICH JEWELS OF BLUE STONES GLITTERED UPON THEIR TURSANS AND THE ROYAL LADIES WERE FULLY AS GORGEOUS AS THEY WERE HAUGHTY AND OVERBEARING
8555-284447-0009 MORNING GIRLS SO BEAUTIFUL AS WELL AS YOU LOOK
8555-284447-0010 CONTROL YOURSELVES AND MY DEARS REPLIED THE VOLUROU THE WORST PUNISHMENT I KNOW HOW TO INFLICT ON ANY ONE THIS PRISONER IS ABOUT TO SUFFER YOU WILL SEE A VERY PRETTY PATCHING MY ROYAL DAUGHTERS
8555-284447-0011 SUPPOSE IT'S OF BREAD
8555-284447-0012 THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD
8555-284447-0013 WHY YOU SIT TO FETCH THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE WE MET AND THAT WAS THE SPIGOAT REPLIED THE CAPTAIN PANTING HARD AS HE HELD FAST TO ONE OF THE GOATS HORNS
8555-284447-0014 THE IDEA OF PATCHING CAPTAIN BILL TO A GOAT WAS VASTLY AMUSING TO HIM AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
8555-284447-0015 THEY LOOK SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUBTFULLY AND THEY'RE NEARLY THE SAME SIZE IF HE STAND ABOVE ON HIS HIGH LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STYLE OF WHISKERS AND THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH SPLENDID
8555-284447-0016 FINE GLORIOUS
8555-284447-0017 WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BULLARO LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME ROLLED AWAY SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUZZLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE
8555-284447-0018 AT ONCE THE BOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPED FROM THE SOLDIERS AND WITH BOWED HEAD RUSHED UPON THE BULLROOM
8555-284447-0019 BEFORE ANY COULD STOP HIM HE BUTTED HIS MAJESTY SO FURIOUSLY THAT THE KING SORTED FAR INTO THE AIR AND TUMBLED IN A HEAP AMONG THE BENCHES WHERE HE LAY MOANING AND GROANING
8555-284447-0020 THE GOATS WARLIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THIS SUCCESSFUL ATTACK
8555-284447-0021 THEN THEY SPED IN GREAT HASTE FOR THE DOOR AND THE GO GAVE A FINAL BUTT THAT SENT THE ROW OF ROYAL LADIES ALL DIVING INTO THE CORRIDOR IN ANOTHER TANGLE WHEREUPON THEY SHRIEKED IN A MANNER THAT TERRIFIED EVERYONE WITHIN SOUND OF THEIR VOICES
8555-284447-0022 I HAD A NOTION IT WAS YOU MADE TO SAVE ME FROM THE KNIFE
8555-284447-0023 I COULDN'T SHIVER MUCH BEING BOUND SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I LOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JUST SWUNG GOOD SHIVER TO RELIEVE MY FEELINGS
8555-284447-0024 COME AND GET THE BULLARRO SHE SAID GOING TOWARD THE BENCHES
8555-284449-0000 SO THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THEIR GIRL QUEEN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE BLAST OF TRUMPETS AND ROLL OF DRUMS AND CLASHING OF CYMBALS TOLD TROT AND CAPTAIN BILL THAT THE BLUE BANDS HAD ASSEMBLED BEFORE THE PALACE
8555-284449-0001 THEN THEY ALL MARCHED OUT A LITTLE WAY INTO THE FIELDS AND FOUND THAT THE ARMY OF PINKIES HAD ALREADY FORMED AND WAS ADVANCING STEADILY TOWARD THEM
8555-284449-0002 AT THE HEAD OF THE PINKIES WERE GIP A SIZZEL AND BUT EM BRIGHT WHO HAD THE PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY CAPTAIN CORLEY AND CATCHING TEN TENT AND ROSILY THE WITCH
8555-284449-0003 WHEN THE BLUE SKIN SAW DICK CASTLE THEY RAISED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUT FOR HE WAS THE FAVOURITE OF THE SOLDIERS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE
8555-284449-0004 SINCE LAST THURSDAY I KEEP THIS IS ALL HAVE BEEN THE LAWFUL BULLRY OF THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE CONQUERED BY QUEEN CHAT I SUPPOSE I AM CONQUERED TOO AND YOU HAVE NO BOWLAROO AT ALL
8555-284449-0005 WHEN HE FINISHED SHE SAID CHEERFULLY
8555-284449-0006 DON'T WORRY SAYS ILL DEAR IT'LL ALL COME RIGHT PRETTY SOON
8555-284449-0007 NOW THEN LET'S ENTER THE CITY AND ENJOY THE GREAT FEAST THAT'S BEING COOKED I'M NEARLY STORMED MYSELF FOR THIS CONQUERING KINGDOMS IS HARD WORK
8555-284449-0008 THEN SHE GAVE ROSALIE BACK HER MIND TO GREEN THANKING THE KIND WHICH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM
8555-284449-0009 YOU ARE A MATE REPLIED THE SAILOR
8555-284449-0010 IT WILL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION
8555-284449-0011 THE GUARDS HAD A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH THE GOAT WHICH WAS LOOSE IN THE ROOM AND STILL WANTED TO FIGHT BUT FINALLY THEY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND THEN THEY TOOK THE BULLET ROOM OUT OF THE FRAME WHOSE TIED IN AND BROUGHT BOTH HIM AND THE GOAT BEFORE QUEEN TROT WHO AWAITED THEM IN THE THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE
8555-284449-0012 I'LL GLADLY DO THAT PROMISED THE NEW BULLIER ROOM AND I'LL FEED THE HONORABLE GOAT ALL THE SHAVINGS AND LEATHER AND TIN CANSY CAN EAT BESIDES THE GRASS
8555-284449-0013 EXCUSE ME SAID SHOT I NEGLECT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BULLAROO ANY MORE

8555-284449-0016 AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN I SHALL BE A MODEL OF DEPORTMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO BE OTHERWISE
8555-284449-0017 WHEN FIRST THEY ENTERED THE THRONE ROOM THEY TRIED TO BE AS HAUGHTY AND SCORNFUL AS EVER BUT THE BLUES WHO WERE ASSEMBLED THERE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM ENDEARED THEM FOR THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN ALL THE BLUE COUNTRY WHO LOVED THE PRINCESS IS THE LEAST LITTLE BIT
8555-284449-0018 SO GIVE THISESEL ORDERED THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE A FILE OF SOLDIERS AND ESCORT THE RAVING BEAUTIES TO THEIR NEW HOME
8555-284449-0019 THAT EVENING TROTH GAVE A GRAND BALL IN THE PALACE TO WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE PINKIES AND THE BLUE SKINS WERE INVITED
8555-284449-0020 THE COMBINED BANDS OF BOTH THE COUNTRIES PLAYED THE MUSIC AND A FINE SUPPER WAS SERVED
8555-292519-0000 BRIGHTER THAN EARLY DAWNS MOST BRILLIANT DIE ARE BLOWN CLEAR BANDS OF COLOR THROUGH THE SKY THAT SWIRL AND SWEEP AND MEAT TO BREAK AND FOAM LIKE RAINBOW VEILS UPON A BUBBLES DOME
