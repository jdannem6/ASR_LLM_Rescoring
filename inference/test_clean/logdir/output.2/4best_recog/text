1320-122617-0036 GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SEND IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS IN THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
1320-122617-0037 THE DELAWARE DOGS HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
1320-122617-0038 WILL THE HERUNDS HEAR HIS GROANS
1320-122617-0039 THE MOHAKINS STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BOAST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0041 UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PORTIONS
1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLEW AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE IMAGINATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT APPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAP LOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UN TIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO READING IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0005 I WAS ABSENT BROTHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUPLICET WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANISTER A MAN WHO IS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMGED AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPPES I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0009 THEY TURNED OF WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN THE CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0011 A BROKEN TIP OF LAND WAS LYING THERE ALSO
1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOU OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SOUGHT US IN IT
1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY IN DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0014 TO THE BEST OF MY BEHALF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
1580-141083-0015 DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINCEER
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY AT COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
1580-141083-0017 SO THAT SEEMS TO ME
1580-141083-0018 NOW MISTER SONGS AT YOUR DISPOSAL
1580-141083-0019 ABOVE WHERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
1580-141083-0020 THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIP TOE WITH HIS NECK CRYING HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID OUR LORD TO GUIDE
1580-141083-0022 I' AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
1580-141083-0023 ONE COULD HARDLY HOP FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
1580-141083-0024 YOU LEFT HIM IN THE CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
1580-141083-0025 THE MEN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHED BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
1580-141083-0026 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SAMS FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
1580-141083-0027 HOW LONG WERE IT TAKEN TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
1580-141083-0028 THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZEED THE NEXT
1580-141083-0029 HE IS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0030 MISTER SOLEMN WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
1580-141083-0031 HOMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS END AND THE SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
1580-141083-0032 WATS AND I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AND INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
1580-141083-0033 I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE ROPE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
1580-141083-0034 AS HOMES THROUGH THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND IN LUTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
1580-141083-0035 CALMS TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HULLO WHAT IS THIS
1580-141083-0036 HOME HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
1580-141083-0037 WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE BRUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
1580-141083-0038 I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141083-0039 AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THOSE EXAMINATION YES
1580-141083-0040 ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROVES
1580-141083-0041 LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE ROOFS
1580-141083-0042 MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE HAS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
1580-141083-0043 THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MACLARON
1580-141083-0044 I THEN NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
1580-141083-0045 HE WAS STILL SUFFER FROM THE SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
1580-141083-0046 BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THINGS AT OTHER TIMES
1580-141083-0047 DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON A TABLE
1580-141083-0048 HOW CAME HERE TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
1580-141083-0049 ANYONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR

1580-141084-0001 HE WAS PACING STIFFLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
1580-141084-0002 THE SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT USUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
1580-141084-0003 NO NAME'S PLEASE SAID HOMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GULCRY'S DOOR
1580-141084-0004 OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS NOTING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0005 THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOMS

1580-141084-0007 TO TOMORROW WAS THE EXAMINATION
1580-141084-0008 I CAN'T ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
1580-141084-0009 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A PHYSICIAN THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
1580-141084-0010 I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE COUNCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BYE
1580-141084-0011 WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
1580-141084-0012 THE FOUL MOUTH FELLOW AT THE TOP
1580-141084-0013 HE IS THE ONE WHAT THE WORST RECORD
1580-141084-0014 WHY BANISHER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTER
1580-141084-0015 HE IMPRESSED ME IS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
1580-141084-0016 MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT STRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
1580-141084-0017 NO GOOD MY DEAR WADSON

1580-141084-0019 YES MY DEAR WHATSON I HAVE SOLVE THE MYSTERY
1580-141084-0020 LOOKS AT THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
1580-141084-0021 ON THE PALM WHERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF BLACK DOUGHY CLAY
1580-141084-0022 AND ONCE MORE THIS MORNING
1580-141084-0023 IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DELEMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
1580-141084-0024 HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL EDUCATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THINK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
1580-141084-0025 YOU KNOW HIS I THINK SO
1580-141084-0026 IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE PORT MARSHAL
1580-141084-0027 NO SIR CERTAINLY THAT
1580-141084-0028 THERE WAS NO MEN SIR
1580-141084-0029 HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCEED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
1580-141084-0030 JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HUMS
1580-141084-0031 WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GO CREST HOW YOU AN HONORABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY

1580-141084-0033 COME COME SAID HOME'S KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO HEIR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL
1580-141084-0034 WELL I DON'T TROUBLE TO ANSWER LISTEN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU KNOW INJUSTICE
1580-141084-0035 HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS OF HIS OWN OFFICE
1580-141084-0036 THE INDEED I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF
1580-141084-0037 WHEN I APPROACHED HER ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW
1580-141084-0038 NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A SENSE
1580-141084-0039 I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY COUNTENANCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SIDE TABLE
1580-141084-0040 HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE WHERE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES
1580-141084-0041 NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAVE IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
1580-141084-0042 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROVES
1580-141084-0043 SHE PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE
1580-141084-0044 GOVES SAID THE YOUNG MAN
1580-141084-0045 SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY ESCAPE
1580-141084-0046 HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER GHOST
1580-141084-0047 I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER SOME'S WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT
1580-141084-0048 IT WOULD BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
1580-141084-0049 IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL OUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
1580-141084-0050 IF MISTER SAMS SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
1995-1826-0000 IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
1995-1826-0001 THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLES IN OR NEW ORLEANS
1995-1826-0002 JOHN TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COTTAGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON
1995-1826-0003 BETTER GO HE SAID COUNSEL SENTIMENTIOUSLY
1995-1826-0004 MIGHT LEARNED SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THERE
1995-1826-0005 BUT JOHN IF NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY WORK
1995-1826-0006 BEEN LOOKING UP TOMBES COUNTY
1995-1826-0007 FIVE AND CURS WELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RADED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
1995-1826-0008 SOME OTHERS TWO BE AT COTTON COUNTY
1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASSES
1995-1826-0010 AT ANY RATE I SAID GO
1995-1826-0011 HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMILE OF CONFUSED ORDERS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPYES AND REFORMS
1995-1826-0013 SO FOR THE HUNTERTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
1995-1826-0014 CUTTING SHE PAUSED
1995-1826-0015 SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHINUCH AND SIGHT
1995-1826-0016 A GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF PORCHRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1826-0018 HER REGARDS SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
1995-1826-0019 ROTTEN IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY
1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARKED SEEM COLD FOR
1995-1826-0021 DON'T KNOW WHAT OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR THEY'LL BE BORNE IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
1995-1826-0022 I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION
1995-1826-0023 GHOSTS DON'T GROW ON TO TOPS OF BADS BUT ON THE GROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YEAMS IS THAT SO
1995-1826-0024 THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HARKENED
1995-1826-0025 SOMETIMES YOU TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU
1995-1826-0026 NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING CURTAIN
1995-1836-0000 THE HONORABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
1995-1836-0001 AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS LATER FOR THE SENATE
1995-1836-0002 WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHERMEN
1995-1836-0003 SHE WAS NOT HERSELF UN NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE AND OTHERS
1995-1836-0004 AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND HISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO NIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES FRIGHTEN THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY KRIGHTEN MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESTWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCULAR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE OLDESS BY THE MORNING OF GIVING OF CAPTAIN ENTRANCE EARLIER IN THE WAY
1995-1836-0005 MISSUS GRAY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO FOUR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
1995-1836-0006 SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESTFALL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
1995-1836-0007 DO BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MISS TAYLOR
1995-1836-0008 I BELIEVE IN THE TRAININ OF PEOPLE TO THE TASK CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM
1995-1836-0009 BUT CRESSWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES
1995-1836-0010 THE VANDORPOOLS WERE SURE THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTINCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GRAY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPER SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
1995-1836-0011 FALLS AATIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
1995-1836-0012 BUT WILL NEITHER EXACTLY WELCOME
1995-1836-0013 MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZOR TO MISSUS GRAY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
1995-1836-0014 FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDER WHO NORTHERNOES AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
1995-1837-0000 HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZORES MUST BE RUINED
1995-1837-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE LATIN ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
1995-1837-0002 AH THE SWAMP OF THE CRUEL SWAMP
1995-1837-0003 THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNR RISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
1995-1837-0004 HE FANCIED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
1995-1837-0005 SHE WAS SO STRANGE ANDHUMAN CREATURE
1995-1837-0006 A WORLD WAS WATER VEILED IN MISTS
1995-1837-0007 THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MID DAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAM
1995-1837-0008 WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINATIONING
1995-1837-0009 THE LUGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DYKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW
1995-1837-0010 PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING SWEEPING
1995-1837-0011 HE STARTLED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
1995-1837-0012 HE SPLASHED TO STAMP ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPAR OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
1995-1837-0013 THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY
1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWIE
1995-1837-0015 THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOWS
1995-1837-0016 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID A GAP WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST THE TREE
1995-1837-0017 HE GAZED ABOUT WHAT PERPLEXED ASTONISHED
1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUG IT AND NOW FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
1995-1837-0019 HE SAT DOWN WEEK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST SORA
1995-1837-0020 THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WAS TEN
1995-1837-0021 THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS ON THE LAND
1995-1837-0022 UP IN THE SICK ROOM SOAR LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
1995-1837-0023 THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING ROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEEKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
1995-1837-0024 FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR AND HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE OF SUN AND BIRD AND TREE
1995-1837-0025 SHE ROSE WITH A FLEEING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BOARD AS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOOON AND THE ISLAND LOW THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
1995-1837-0028 HIS CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
1995-1837-0029 HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIPLY MADE
2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LIKEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK IN TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORPLACE
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PENS AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PRAYER
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WALL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
2094-142345-0004 AND WENT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW
2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHALE AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS
2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREET SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN NO
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS PASSING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BUILD DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT IS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009 WHERE THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WIDOW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREADLES AND GOSSIP
2094-142345-0010 HEADTY SORROW OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PETER DISHES THEY WERE ARRANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GREAT WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHRILLISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAMOROS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DYNAS'S SYRIAIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARRY
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITH A AIR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LUCTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHARMING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WIDOW'S AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLIE THE HOUSE MADE WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
2094-142345-0015 TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIBLY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
2094-142345-0016 SPINNTING INDEED
2094-142345-0017 I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GALLOWSNESS
2094-142345-0018 WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SCRUB UP FLOOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
2094-142345-0019 COME THE WOLF FOR THE WIDOW'S INDEED
2094-142345-0020 THAT'S WHAT YOUD LIKE TO BE DOING IS IT
2094-142345-0021 THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOU LET'S THE ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HEADLONGS TO RUIN
2094-142345-0022 MISTER ELLA'S INDEED
2094-142345-0023 YOU ARE ARABIN FOR SITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER ITS TIME TO PUT BY
2094-142345-0024 MONEY MY IRONS TRY TOLD BE YOU PUT IT DOWN TO WARM
2094-142345-0025 COLD IS IT MY DARLING BLESS HER SWEET FACE
2094-142345-0026 SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRONING THINGS AWAKE
2094-142345-0027 MONEY I DID LIE TO DO INTO THE BARN TO TOMMY TO SEE THE WIT ODD
2094-142345-0028 NO NO TODDY'D GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED OF MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0030 TONY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF VIEW TOO IN RACHEL
2094-142345-0032 I OFTEN HEARD OR TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT MAN ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH AND YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I' AM TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEATING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TAWLINGS ISN'T MADE UP
2094-142345-0035 BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE AND SAID DYNAH
2094-142345-0036 MAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK IN THEIR FAMILIES
2094-142345-0037 WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SOURCES OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US TO IT
2094-142345-0038 I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOLES OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
2094-142345-0039 I'VE STRONGEST SERVANTS THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I'VE DONE
2094-142345-0040 I DIDN'T PREACH WITHIN DIRECTION
2094-142345-0041 DIRECTIONS
2094-142345-0042 I ADD A COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU
2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES HE WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN
2094-142345-0044 SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH ITS STATELY CORDIALITY
2094-142345-0045 OH SO DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0046 I DEPART IN YOUR KITCHEN
2094-142345-0047 POYSER IS NOT AT HOME HIS HE
2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN DONTYHORN SITTING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSADOR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WAR
2094-142345-0050 BUT THERE'S FATHER IN BARON SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
2094-142345-0051 NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WEELBS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
2094-142345-0052 I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANTED TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
2094-142345-0053 FOR IF IS EVERYWHERE ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
2094-142345-0054 OH SURE SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
2094-142345-0055 BUT YOU'RE KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAT I DO SIR
2094-142345-0056 I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURNING YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
2094-142345-0057 I KNOWS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BE IT
2094-142345-0058 BY THE BY I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY YOU MUST SEE YOUR DEARRY MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MOUNT PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0060 OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
2300-131720-0000 THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS AND HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT
2300-131720-0002 THERE MESSORS JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0003 THE DINIMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS ADD MEDICINE HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECT HIS STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0006 THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGED
2300-131720-0007 BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE AND THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIO SINCRATICLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
2300-131720-0008 EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSORPATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND THASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTRICPLAATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE GEORGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARMHOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND ITS IDEAL
2300-131720-0012 MEDICINE WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHOTY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALLANTOMETER
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTH RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNMENT REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP MEDICINE REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014 MISTERERSON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOW WITH A FRICTION BREAK ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER MEDICINE INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCED LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017 ELLISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM OF NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARCH SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FORCE SAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDIZON'S SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION IT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLATE ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021 THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY ATISON TO BUILD AN EQUIPPED CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WAR SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER ELLISON BEING INDEPENDENT IN BANNERS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISAN CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE TENT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVED MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF AT ASONIA BUT THEY REMAINED IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS ONE INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0026 THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE CUSTOMERS PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0027 ELLISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT APPOINTED USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029 HENCE THE EDISON ELECTRIC LEADER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE OEDISON ELECTRIC METRE IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM IN ACCURACY AND IMMINITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD EDISEN METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE MEETER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SAT BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METRE THEN MORE GENERALLY INUSED THAN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVID END BASIS
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISED METRE WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
2300-131720-0036 THE MEETING CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037 HE WEIGHED AND REWAYED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038 HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS OTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM WAS ASSAULT
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PARTY
2300-131720-0041 WE HAD MEETERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHE AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNOR THE GARDENER WHO SINCE PAUL'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS A MANS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS PUTNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0003 SOMEHOW OF ALL THAT DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004 IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE BROWNIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID MAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT PROPPED PHRONSIE
237-126133-0007 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STORE PHRONSIE AND ALL
237-126133-0008 ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSED A POLLY'S OWN
237-126133-0009 NOW HE'LL STAY CRIED MAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU

237-126133-0013 I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU
237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE AN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE AT JASPER'S SIDE
237-126133-0015 YES ALL ALONG BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
237-126133-0016 OH NO JASPER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWNSELF
237-126133-0017 THERE CHAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PURCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE
237-126133-0018 DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER T WASN'T HER FAULT
237-126133-0019 DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HEAR TOO
237-126133-0020 HOW COULD HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO
237-126133-0021 SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE HE COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE MANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED IN HIGH DUNDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHARP HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
237-126133-0025 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS EYES VIGOROUSLY
237-134493-0000 IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN MERRICKSON DIED
237-134493-0001 HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE HEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKER BORN MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN GAILY PAINTED FARMHOUSES THE GILDED WEATHER VAINS ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE EARTH THOUGH CURIOUSLY MATED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SAT UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
237-134493-0006 THAT'S NOT MUCH OF THE JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TOWN AND BACK
237-134493-0007 AUNT ALEXANDER LET'S YOU SLEEP LATE

237-134493-0012 I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PICKED CHERRIES
237-134493-0013 INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THAT PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING IT
237-134493-0014 THEY THANK YOU'RE PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
237-134493-0015 THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL TRIPNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
