1320-122617-0036 GOD BLESS YOUR FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SON IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS IN THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
1320-122617-0037 THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD IN PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
1320-122617-0038 WILL THE HERENS HEAR HIS GROANS
1320-122617-0039 THE MOWHEANS STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTEND OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0041 UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTY PROPORTIONS
1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLEE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERN
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAVE OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF VAKER STREET
1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY AN TIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO MEET IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0005 I WAS ABSENT MOTHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUPLICIT WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANISTER A MAN WHO IS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUBBAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0008 THE ROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0009 THEY ALL TURN OF WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0011 A BROKEN TIP OF LED WAS LYING THERE ALSO
1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BOTTLE OF BLACK DOW OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SOUGHT US IN IT
1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTL THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0014 TO THE BEST OF MY LEAF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
1580-141083-0015 DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE ROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT OUR DOOR OPEN
1580-141083-0017 SO IT COMES TO ME
1580-141083-0018 NOW MISTER SELLS AT YOUR DISPOSAL
1580-141083-0019 ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS WON ON EACH STORY
1580-141083-0020 THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIP TOE WITH HIS NECK TRAIN HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID OUR OWN TO GUIDE
1580-141083-0022 I M AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
1580-141083-0023 ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANYTHING UPON SO DRY A DAY
1580-141083-0024 YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY A WINDOW THERE
1580-141083-0025 THE MEN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEED BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
1580-141083-0026 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOMS FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
1580-141083-0027 HOW LONG WAS IT TAKEN TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR NOT LESS
1580-141083-0028 THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND EASE THE NEXT
1580-141083-0029 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO RELEASE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0030 MISTER ADAMS WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
1580-141083-0031 HOMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS END END AND THE SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
1580-141083-0032 WATSIN I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
1580-141083-0033 I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE ROSE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
1580-141083-0034 AS HOMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND IN LUERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
1580-141083-0035 HUMMS TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HULLO WHAT IS THIS
1580-141083-0036 HOMES HEAD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
1580-141083-0037 WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE WASHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
1580-141083-0038 I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS TO USE THE STARE AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141083-0039 AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THEIR EXAMINATION YES
1580-141083-0040 ONE HEARTLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
1580-141083-0041 LET US WHO THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
1580-141083-0042 MY SCORE HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
1580-141083-0043 THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MACLERAN
1580-141083-0044 I DINNER NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
1580-141083-0045 HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS WIFE
1580-141083-0046 BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT EITHER TIMES
1580-141083-0047 DID YOU LOOK AT THESE DOORS ON THE TABLE
1580-141083-0048 HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEYS IN THE DOOR
1580-141083-0049 MANY ONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR

1580-141083-0053 YOU HAVE N'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
1580-141084-0000 IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOAD APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
1580-141084-0001 WHO WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
1580-141084-0002 THIS SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
1580-141084-0003 NO NAME'S PLEASE SAID HOMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GIILCRY'S DOOR
1580-141084-0004 OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS NOTING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTIOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0005 THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOMES
1580-141084-0006 YOU DON'T SEEM TO REQUIRE THE POSITION
1580-141084-0007 TO MARCH WAS THE EXAMINATION
1580-141084-0008 I CAN ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
1580-141084-0009 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME FORCE OF ACTION
1580-141084-0010 I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL HUTTINGS GOOD BY
1580-141084-0011 WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
1580-141084-0012 THE FOUL MOUTHS FELL AT THE TOP
1580-141084-0013 HE IS THE ONE WAS THE WORST RECORD
1580-141084-0014 WHY BANNER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTER
1580-141084-0015 HE EXPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
1580-141084-0016 MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT DRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
1580-141084-0017 NO GOOD MY DEAR WAALSON
1580-141084-0018 I THINK SO YOU HAVE FORMED AN CONCLUSION
1580-141084-0019 YES MY DEAR WATSON I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY
1580-141084-0020 LOOK AT THAT HE HELD NOT HIS HAND
1580-141084-0021 ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRIMIDS OF BLACK DOUGHY CLAY
1580-141084-0022 AND WHAT MORE THIS MORNING
1580-141084-0023 IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMENT BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
1580-141084-0024 HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETGED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
1580-141084-0025 YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO IT
1580-141084-0026 IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATECOURT MARSHAL
1580-141084-0027 NO SIR SIR CERTAINLY NOT
1580-141084-0028 THERE WAS NO MEANS SIR
1580-141084-0029 HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANISTER IN THE FURTHER CORNER
1580-141084-0030 JUST PLEASE THE DOOR SAID HOMES
1580-141084-0031 WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GHOST HOW YOU AN HONORABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
1580-141084-0032 FOR A MOMENT GUL CREST WITH UPRAISED HAND TRIED TO CONTROL HIS WRITHING FEATURES
1580-141084-0033 COME COME SAID HOMES KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO AIR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLLESS CRIMINAL
1580-141084-0034 WELL OH DON'T TROUBLE TO ANSWER LISTEN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU KNOW INJUSTICE
1580-141084-0035 HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS AT HIS OWN OFFICE
1580-141084-0036 THE CANADIAN I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF
1580-141084-0037 WHEN I APPROACHED OUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW
1580-141084-0038 NO IN LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
1580-141084-0039 I ENTERED AND I TOOK IT INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SIDE TABLE
1580-141084-0040 HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE WORE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES
1580-141084-0041 NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVE THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
1580-141084-0042 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE TRUTHS
1580-141084-0043 YOU PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE
1580-141084-0044 GLVES SAID THE YOUNG MAN
1580-141084-0045 SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ASLEEP
1580-141084-0046 HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER GORIST
1580-141084-0047 I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER SOM'S WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT
1580-141084-0048 IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE MET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
1580-141084-0049 IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
1580-141084-0050 IF MISTER SONES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
1995-1826-0000 IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIORS SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
1995-1826-0001 THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESGEN OR NEW ORLEANS
1995-1826-0002 JOHN SAILOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON
1995-1826-0003 BETTER GO HE SAID COUNSEL SUBSTANTIALLY
1995-1826-0004 MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING USELESS DOWN THERE
1995-1826-0005 BUT JOHN THERE IS NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY WORK
1995-1826-0006 THAN LOOKING UP TOMB'S COUNTY
1995-1826-0007 FINE AND CURS WELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RAIDED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
1995-1826-0008 SOME OTHERS WHO BE A COTTON COUNTY
1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES ILL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
1995-1826-0010 AT ANY RATE I SAY GOING
1995-1826-0011 HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ORDERS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPYS AND FORMS
1995-1826-0013 SO FOR THE HUNDRED TIMES SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
1995-1826-0014 CUTTON SHE PAUSED
1995-1826-0015 SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH OF SIGHT
1995-1826-0016 THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARDS
1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF PORTRAITRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1826-0018 HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STOCKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AS SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
1995-1826-0019 CAPTAIN IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY
1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARKS SEEMED CALLED FOR
1995-1826-0021 DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR IT'LL BE BORNE IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
1995-1826-0022 I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT' WAS TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION
1995-1826-0023 GOELS DON'T GROW ON TO TOPS OF BOUGHS BUT ON THE GROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE EAMES IS THAT SO
1995-1826-0024 THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE CIVIL FLEECE HE HEARKENED
1995-1826-0025 SUCH TIME YOU TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU
1995-1826-0026 NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THEY WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON
1995-1836-0000 THE HONOURABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UP TOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLEY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
1995-1836-0001 AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES IN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE
1995-1836-0002 WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHERS MEN
1995-1836-0003 SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTICEABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE AND OTHERS
1995-1836-0004 AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND HISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO NIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES FRIGHTEN THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY KRIGHTEN MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESTWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCULAR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE OLDESS BY THE MORNING OF GIVING OF CAPTAIN ENTRANCE EARLIER IN THE DAYS
1995-1836-0005 MISSUS GRACE HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
1995-1836-0006 SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESTLL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
1995-1836-0007 DO BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARY CATERPILLAR
1995-1836-0008 I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THE TASK CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMEN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM
1995-1836-0009 BUT CRESTWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES
1995-1836-0010 THE VANDAPOOLS WERE SURE THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCEING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GRAY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPER SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
1995-1836-0011 FALLSATIVELY HEROIC ADDED CROSWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
1995-1836-0012 BUT WITH NEITHER EXACTLY WELCOME
1995-1836-0013 MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OFZOR TO MISSUS GRAY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
1995-1836-0014 FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDER WHO NEITHER KNOWS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
1995-1837-0000 HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZAR AS MUST BE RUINED
1995-1837-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOST OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
1995-1837-0002 AH THE SWAMP THE COOL SWAMP
1995-1837-0003 THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMEED LIKE A SUN RISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
1995-1837-0004 HE PLANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR NEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
1995-1837-0005 SHE WAS SO STRANGE IN HUMAN CREATURE
1995-1837-0006 THE WORLD WAS WATER SAILED IN MISTS
1995-1837-0007 THEN OF A SUDDEN AND MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STREAM
1995-1837-0008 WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINEDING
1995-1837-0009 THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DIKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW
1995-1837-0010 PERHAPS HE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING
1995-1837-0011 HE SHOUTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
1995-1837-0012 HE SPLASHED TO STAMP ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPARD OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
1995-1837-0013 THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LADOON WAS DRY
1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHTS SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY
1995-1837-0015 THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOWLES
1995-1837-0016 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID A GAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZLY AGAINST THE TREE
1995-1837-0017 HE GAZED ABOUT WOULD PERPLEXED ASTONISHED
1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUGG AGAIN NOW FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
1995-1837-0019 HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST SORRY
1995-1837-0020 THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYYING WERE TEN
1995-1837-0021 THE HOPED AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
1995-1837-0022 UP IN THE SICK ROOM'S ORA LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
1995-1837-0023 THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STOLE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
1995-1837-0024 FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE OF SON AND BIRD AND TREE
1995-1837-0025 SHE AROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN HIS BOARD AS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LOW THE CURTAIN LAY BEFORE HER
1995-1837-0028 THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE GREW
1995-1837-0029 HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PASSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK IN TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORPLACE
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PAINS AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPEN
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PEAR
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOLF STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
2094-142345-0004 AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT END WINDOW
2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLON A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS
2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GRIEF SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAYED NOW
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE CALS SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS PASSING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BUILT DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT IS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009 WHERE THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WITNESS OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREADLESTON GOSSIP
2094-142345-0010 HETTY SORROW OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PETER DISHES THAT WERE ARRANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GREAT WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR FOOLISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAMOROS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DYNAS'S SOFTIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITH A EAR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS TURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WIDOWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLIE THE HOUSE MADE WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
2094-142345-0015 TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLIE HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANS HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
2094-142345-0016 SPINNNE INDEED
2094-142345-0017 I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GOLLOWSNESS

2094-142345-0022 MISTER ELELA'S INDEED
2094-142345-0023 YOU ARE A RAREEN FOR SITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER ITS TIME TO PUT BY
2094-142345-0024 MONEY MY ARMS TRIED TOLD BE THESE PUT IT DOWN TO WARM
2094-142345-0025 COLD ARE IT MY DARLING BLESS YOUR SWEET FACE
2094-142345-0026 SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRON IN THINGS AWAY
2094-142345-0027 MONEY I DID LIE TO DO INTO THE BARN TO TO TOMMY TO SEE THE WIDOWD
2094-142345-0028 NO NO NO TOTTY HAD GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED TO MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0030 TODDY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO THEN RACHEL
2094-142345-0032 I OFTEN READ HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH AND YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND COWLING THAT ISN'T MADE UP
2094-142345-0035 BUT NOT MORE THAN IT'S IN THE BIBLE AND SAID DINAH
2094-142345-0036 NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE COLD TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK IN THEIR FAMILIES
2094-142345-0037 WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDINGLY AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US TO IT
2094-142345-0038 I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOLES OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTIE CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
2094-142345-0039 I'VE STRONGEST SIRENCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FOR ANYTHING I'VE DONE
2094-142345-0040 I DIDN'T PREACH WITHOUT DESTRUCTION
2094-142345-0041 DIRECTLY
2094-142345-0042 I HAND A COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU
2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PAILINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAYING THEY MEANT TO COME IN
2094-142345-0044 SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITIES
2094-142345-0045 OH SURE DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0046 I DELAY IN YOUR KITCHEN
2094-142345-0047 POYSER IS NOT AT HOME THIS HE
2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN DONTIHORN SITTING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO RESSADOR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WALL
2094-142345-0050 BUT THERE'S FATHER IN FOREIGN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
2094-142345-0051 NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WEBBS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
2094-142345-0052 I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WISH TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
2094-142345-0053 FOR IF IS ANYWHERE ON THE FIRE WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
2094-142345-0054 OH SIR SAID MISSUS OYSTER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
2094-142345-0055 BUT YOU KNEW MORE ABOUT THAT THAT I DO SIR
2094-142345-0056 I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TAKE YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
2094-142345-0057 I KNOWS HARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT
2094-142345-0058 BY THE BY I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DARRY MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK HANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0060 OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPABLE ORDER
2300-131720-0000 THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT OF THE CRISTEL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUGT
2300-131720-0002 THERE MESSIRRS JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0003 THE DYNIMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS ELLISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECT THE STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0006 THERE COMES NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
2300-131720-0007 BROUGHT AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIO SINCRATICLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
2300-131720-0008 EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERBATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND THESEIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE GEORGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FAR MILES THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND HIS IDEAL
2300-131720-0012 ELLISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHOTY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GOVERNOMETER
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNMENT REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNIMO AND LAMP MEDICINE REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014 MISTER CITIZEN WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTIONBREAK ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR A CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER MEDICINE INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017 MEDICINE HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARCH SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TOO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON BEFORE SAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISAN'S SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION IT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND HE GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLAN ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021 THE SWEET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY ADDISON TO BUILD AN EQUIPPED CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HARPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER ELLISON BEING INDEPENDENT IN BANNERS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AS IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVED MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF AT SONYA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS ONE INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0026 THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMERS PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO RELATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0027 CITIZEN HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METRE
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTACHIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINTED USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029 HENCE THE EDISON ELECTRIC READER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE OEDISON ELECTRIC METOR IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM IN ACCURACY AND IMUNITY FROM SUCH TEMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD EDERSON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE MEETER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SAT BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JAMES READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METRE THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVID AND BASIS
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDIZON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISED METRE WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
2300-131720-0036 THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037 HE WEIGHED AND REWAID THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038 HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BUT
2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PARTS
2300-131720-0041 WE HAD METERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTOMS OF LIQUID
237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHE AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURN OR THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS USED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WITNESS YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0003 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THISDAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004 IT IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID MAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LEFT
237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLE HAPPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
237-126133-0007 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE STUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL
237-126133-0008 ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSED AT POLLY'S OWN
237-126133-0009 NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED THE MAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU
237-126133-0010 OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAN ME LET HER COME
237-126133-0011 ISN'T HE SPLENDID CRIED JASPER IN INTENSE PRIDE SMELLING UP FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT
237-126133-0012 THERE THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FUS HE HEAD
237-126133-0013 I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WONT ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU
237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
237-126133-0015 YES ALL ALONG BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING CURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
237-126133-0016 AH NO CHAPTER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
237-126133-0017 THERE JACK YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIDE OF JASPER'S FACE
237-126133-0018 DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER PLUSN'T HER FAULT
237-126133-0019 DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HAIR TOO
237-126133-0020 HOW DID HER MOTHER NEVER LET HER GO
237-126133-0021 SHE ASKED IMPULSITLY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPICENTLY
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED IN HIGH DUNGEAN JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A BASE OF TIME
237-126133-0025 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACES VIGOROUSLY
237-134493-0000 IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BURNS AND DIED
237-134493-0001 HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE NEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORTHWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKER BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN GAILY PAINTED FARMHOUSES THE GILDED WEATHER LANES ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE EARTH ARE CURIOUSLY MATEED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS GROW
237-134493-0006 THAT'S NOT MUCH O A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TOWN AND BACK
237-134493-0007 ALEXANDER LET'S YOU SLEEP LAD
237-134493-0008 SHE GATHERED UP HER RINGS
237-134493-0009 PLEASE WAIT FOR ME MARI A MEAL COAXED
237-134493-0010 I NEVER SEE LOSE SIGH OVER HERE
237-134493-0011 HOW BROWN YOU'VE GOT SINCE YOU CAME HOME I WISH I HAD AN ADELATE TO KNOW MY ORCHARD
237-134493-0012 I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PICK CERRIES
237-134493-0013 INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SEEN IT
237-134493-0014 THEY THINK YOURE PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
237-134493-0015 THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL TRIM MISS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
