1320-122617-0036 GOD BLESS YOUR FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SEND IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS IN THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
1320-122617-0037 THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARDS AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
1320-122617-0038 WILL THE HERINS HEAR HIS GROANS
1320-122617-0039 THE MOHEANS STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONE THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0041 UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN MUTUAL PROPORTIONS
1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLEW AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERN
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE HESITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BOKER STREET
1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY ON TIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRUPT
1580-141083-0005 I WAS ABSENT WHETHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANISTER A MAN WHO WAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUBBED AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL ALTOGETHER
1580-141083-0009 THEY TURN OF WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN THE CHAIR WHEN I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0011 A BROKEN TIP OF LAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BOTTLE OF BLACK DOAU OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SOUGHT US IN IT
1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIR TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0014 TO THE BEST OF MY GRIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
1580-141083-0015 DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE ROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRIED TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
1580-141083-0017 SOME IT SEEMS TO ME
1580-141083-0018 NOW MISTER SIMPSONS AT YOUR DISPOSAL
1580-141083-0019 ABOVE WHERE THREE STUDENTS WON ON EACH STORY
1580-141083-0020 THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIP TOE WITH HIS NET TRAIN HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID OUR LAND TO GUIDE
1580-141083-0022 I BE AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
1580-141083-0023 ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR MANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
1580-141083-0024 YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH TERROR BY THE WINDOW THERE
1580-141083-0025 THE MEN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHED BY SHEET FROM THE SENTRAL TABLE
1580-141083-0026 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOM'S FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
1580-141083-0027 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKEN TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR NOT LESS
1580-141083-0028 THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SQUEEZED THE NEXT
1580-141083-0029 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOU RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0030 MISTER SUMMONS WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
1580-141083-0031 HOMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS IN AN AND THE SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
1580-141083-0032 WATSEN I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
1580-141083-0033 I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE ROAD WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
1580-141083-0034 AS HOMES THROUGH THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND IN LEARNTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
1580-141083-0035 HOMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLO WHAT IS THIS
1580-141083-0036 HARMS HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
1580-141083-0037 WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HERSELF
1580-141083-0038 I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS YOU USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141083-0039 AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION GUESS
1580-141083-0040 ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THRILL SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
1580-141083-0041 LET US KNOW THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
1580-141083-0042 MY SQUIRE HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
1580-141083-0043 THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MC CLAERON
1580-141083-0044 I DON NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
1580-141083-0045 HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THEIR SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
1580-141083-0046 BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIME
1580-141083-0047 DID YOU LOOKED AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
1580-141083-0048 HOW CAME YO TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
1580-141083-0049 ANYTHING IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
1580-141083-0050 I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HARMS

1580-141083-0053 YOU YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
1580-141084-0000 IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILOADE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
1580-141084-0001 HE WAS PAPING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
1580-141084-0002 THE SET OF ROMES IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
1580-141084-0003 NO NAME'S PLEASE SAID HOMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GILLRY'S DOOR
1580-141084-0004 OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZED THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0005 THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOS
1580-141084-0006 YOU DON'T MEAN TO REALIZE THE POSITION
1580-141084-0007 TO MORE WAS THE EXAMINATION
1580-141084-0008 I CAN ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
1580-141084-0009 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COARSE OF ACTION
1580-141084-0010 I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOODBY
1580-141084-0011 WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE GRADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
1580-141084-0012 THE FOUL MOUSE FELLOW AT THE TOP
1580-141084-0013 SHE IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST RECORD
1580-141084-0014 WHY BANISTER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS NAME IN THE MATTER
1580-141084-0015 HE IMPRESSED ME WITH BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
1580-141084-0016 MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATIONS
1580-141084-0017 NO GOOD MY DEAR WASON
1580-141084-0018 I THINK SO YOU HAVE FORMED THE CONCLUSION
1580-141084-0019 YES MY DEAR WATSAN I HAVE SOLVE THE MYSTERY
1580-141084-0020 LOOK AT THAT HE HELD AT HIS HAND
1580-141084-0021 ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF BLACK DOLLY CLAY
1580-141084-0022 AND ONE MORE THAT MORNING
1580-141084-0023 IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE LIMIT BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
1580-141084-0024 HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THINGS HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
1580-141084-0025 DO YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
1580-141084-0026 IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE QUARTER MARSHAL
1580-141084-0027 OH SIR CERTAINLY NOT
1580-141084-0028 THERE WAS NO MAN SUR
1580-141084-0029 HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANISTER IN THE FAR CORNER
1580-141084-0030 JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES
1580-141084-0031 WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GO CREST HOW YOU AN HONOURABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY

1580-141084-0035 HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS TO HIS OWN OFFICE
1580-141084-0036 THE INDIAN I ALSO SAID NOTHING OF
1580-141084-0037 WHEN I REACHED YOUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW
1580-141084-0038 NO NONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
1580-141084-0039 I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS ON THE SIDE TABLE
1580-141084-0040 HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE WEAR WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIQUES
1580-141084-0041 NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
1580-141084-0042 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THAT PROOFS
1580-141084-0043 HE PUT HIS SHOES UPON THE TABLE
1580-141084-0044 G LOVES SAID THE YOUNG MAN

1580-141084-0048 IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LAID THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
1580-141084-0049 IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD NOW
1580-141084-0050 IF MISTER SOLEMNS SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
1995-1826-0000 IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEEN AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
1995-1826-0001 THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESMAN OR NEW ORLEANS
1995-1826-0002 JOHN DALE WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON
1995-1826-0003 BETTER GO HE SAID COUNSEL SIMULTANEOUSLY
1995-1826-0004 MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THEY
1995-1826-0005 BUT JOHN OF NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY WORK
1995-1826-0006 MEN LOOKING UP TOMB'S COUNTY
1995-1826-0007 FIVE AND CURS WELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RAIDED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
1995-1826-0008 SOME OTHERS TOO BE AT COTTON COUNTY
1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROERS I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
1995-1826-0010 AT ANY RATE I SAYING GO
1995-1826-0011 HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN IN THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODORS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PURITANICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPYS AND REFORMS
1995-1826-0013 SO FOR THE HUNDRED TIME SHE WAS THINKING TODAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
1995-1826-0014 CURTAIN SHE PAUSED
1995-1826-0015 SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHOUT TOUCH AND SIGHT
1995-1826-0016 THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHED AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF PORT TREE HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1826-0018 HER GUARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STOCKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
1995-1826-0019 FORGOTTEN IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY
1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARKS SEEMED COLD FOR
1995-1826-0021 DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LET HER BE BORNE AND COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
1995-1826-0022 I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN BECAME THE EXPLOSION
1995-1826-0023 GOOES DON'T GROW ON TO TOPS OF BADS BUT ON THE GROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE EAMES IS THAT SO
1995-1826-0024 THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SELF A FLEECE HE HEARKENED
1995-1826-0025 CENTRE AM YOU TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU
1995-1826-0026 NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING RAWDON
1995-1836-0000 THE HONORABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UP TOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLY'S WALLS STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
1995-1836-0001 AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS CELEBRATED FOR THE SENATE
1995-1836-0002 WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS ANOTHER MEN
1995-1836-0003 SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOK TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS
1995-1836-0004 AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND HISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO NIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES FRIGHTEN THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY KRIGHTEN MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESTWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCULAR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE OLDESS BY THE MORNING OF GIVING OF CAPTAIN ENTRANCE EARLIER IN THE BAY
1995-1836-0005 MISSUS GRAHAM HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
1995-1836-0006 SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST DEGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESTWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
1995-1836-0007 DO BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARY SAILOR
1995-1836-0008 I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THE TASK CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HARDILY SECONDED HIM
1995-1836-0009 BUT CRESWALL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES
1995-1836-0010 THE VANDORPOOLS WERE SURE THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCEING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GRAY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPER SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
1995-1836-0011 FALLSATIVELY HEROIC ADDED CORSWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
1995-1836-0012 BUT WE NOT A EXACTLY WELCOME
1995-1836-0013 MARY TAILOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZOOR TO MISSUS GRAY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
1995-1836-0014 FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDER WHO NOR THE KNOWS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
1995-1837-0000 HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND SORE AS MUST BE RUINED
1995-1837-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTAGE ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
1995-1837-0002 AH THE SWAMP FOR THE CRUEL SWARMP
1995-1837-0003 THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUN RISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN LEARNING WONDER
1995-1837-0004 HE MEANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
1995-1837-0005 SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND HUMANE CREATURE
1995-1837-0006 THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED TO MISTS
1995-1837-0007 THEN OF A SUDDEN HAD MID DAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAM
1995-1837-0008 WHERE WAS THE HOUSE OF IMAGINING
1995-1837-0009 THE LUDOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DYKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW
1995-1837-0010 PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITED WEEPING
1995-1837-0011 HE STARTED WITH THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
1995-1837-0012 HE FLASHED TO STAMP ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAM PART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
1995-1837-0013 THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRIED
1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWERY
1995-1837-0015 THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVI WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BULLS
1995-1837-0016 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAIN WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST THE TREE
1995-1837-0017 HE GAZED ABOUT IT PERPLEXED ASTONISHED
1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUG LIKE A NOW FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
1995-1837-0019 HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UTTERMOST SORA
1995-1837-0020 THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE ATTEND
1995-1837-0021 THE HOPE AND STREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
1995-1837-0022 UP IN THE SICK ROOM SOA LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
1995-1837-0023 THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROLL FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEEKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
1995-1837-0024 FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SON AND BIRD AND TREE
1995-1837-0025 SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULLESS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROAN AND WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LOW THE AUTUMN LAY BEFORE HER
1995-1837-0028 THE CHAIR WAS GUILTY BUT HE KNEW
1995-1837-0029 HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSEED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORPLACE
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PAYS AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PARISH
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BEAR BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
2094-142345-0004 AND WALK THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW
2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOSE HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHALE AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS
2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS KNOWS
2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE WAS PLAIN NOW
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE CALS SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS PASSING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BUILD DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITHAS MUCH BODY IN IT IS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009 WHERE THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WIDOW OTHERWISE SADDLEER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREADLESTON GOSSIP
2094-142345-0010 HETTY SORROW OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PETER DISHES THEY WERE ARRANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL BITTER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GREAT WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWD IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPED LIGHT FOOTED
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAMORIS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DYNAS'S SYRIAIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARRY
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITH THE EAR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LUCTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS JOURNEYING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WIDOW'S AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLIE THE HOUSE MADE WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
2094-142345-0015 TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLIE HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIBLY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
2094-142345-0016 SPINNE INDEED
2094-142345-0017 I NEVER KNEW YOUR EAGLES FOR GALLOWSNESS
2094-142345-0018 WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SCRUB A FLOOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
2094-142345-0019 COME THE WOLF FOR THE WIDOWS INDEED
2094-142345-0020 THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE LIKE TO BE DOING IS IT
2094-142345-0021 THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOU THEY'S THE ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HEADLONGS TO RUIN
2094-142345-0022 MISTER OLAYS INDEED
2094-142345-0023 YOU ARE RAREIN FOR SITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER ITS TIME TO PUT BY
2094-142345-0024 MONEY MY IRONS TWICE TOLD BE YOU PUT IT DOWN TO WARM
2094-142345-0025 GOLD IS IT MY DARLING BLESS YOUR SWEET FACE
2094-142345-0026 SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRONING THINGS WAY
2094-142345-0027 MONEY I DID LIE TO DO INTO THE BARN TO TOMMY TO SEE THE WOOD ODD
2094-142345-0028 NO NO NO TODDY HAD GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYES HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0030 TOTIE HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO LATE RACHEL
2094-142345-0032 I OFTEN HURT OR TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT MAN ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH AND YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEATING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND COWLING THAT ISN'T MADE UP
2094-142345-0035 BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE ANNE SAID DINAH
2094-142345-0036 NOW DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK IN THEIR FAMILIES
2094-142345-0037 WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR PLOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US TO IT
2094-142345-0038 I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOLES OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TADDY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
2094-142345-0039 I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I'VE DONE
2094-142345-0040 I DIDNT PREACH WITHOUT DIRECTION
2094-142345-0041 ACTION
2094-142345-0042 I HAD A COMMON IMPATIENCE WITH YOU
2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMAN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN
2094-142345-0044 SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH IS STATELY CORDIALITY
2094-142345-0045 OH SOON DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0046 BY DELIGHT IN YOUR KITCHEN
2094-142345-0047 POYSER AS NOT AT HOME IS HE
2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN DONNY THORN SITTING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DARRY DOOR
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSIDER TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WALL
2094-142345-0050 BUT THERE'S FATHER IN VAIN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
2094-142345-0051 NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WEILBS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
2094-142345-0052 I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I GOING TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
2094-142345-0053 FOR IF IS SOMEWHERE ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
2094-142345-0054 OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE AT ALL
2094-142345-0055 BUT YOU NO MORE ABOUT THAT THAT I DO SIR
2094-142345-0056 I THINK I SHOULD BE GOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
2094-142345-0057 I THOSE FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT
2094-142345-0058 BY THE BY I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DEARRRY MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERRUPTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0060 OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITUL ORDER
2300-131720-0000 THE PARISH PLAN LIKE THAT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS AND THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUGT
2300-131720-0002 THERE MESSIRES JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0003 THE DINNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS ADDISM HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECTSTATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0006 THERE LIVES NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
2300-131720-0007 BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIO SCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
2300-131720-0008 EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSURBATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND HEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE TO RICH BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARHOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND ITS IDEAL
2300-131720-0012 MEDICINE WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALLOMETER
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNMENT REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP MEDICINE REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014 MISTER SIMPSON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BREAK ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATER TO VERIFY IT
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LIBERCATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER MEDICINE INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017 ELLISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM OF NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARCH SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TOO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FORM SAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE ELLISON'S SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION IT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLAT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDER SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021 THE SWEET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY ADDISON TO BUILD AN EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOBBKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER ELLISON BEING INDEPENDENT IN BANNERS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDICON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVED MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF AT ASSASSINIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS ONE INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0026 THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMERS PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREETLIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0027 LEVISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTNGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINTED USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029 HENCE THE EDICIAN ELECTRIC READER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTRIC METRE IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM IN ACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE MEETER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDANT BASIS
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISEN ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISED METRE WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METRE
2300-131720-0036 THE MEETRE CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037 HE WEIGHED AND REWAILED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038 HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST THEM AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM WAS BOUGHT
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PORT
2300-131720-0041 WE HAD METERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF FREQUENT
237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHE AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNUR THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS THE MANS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS CEASED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS HITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0003 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT LOOKED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004 IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE FANCY FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID MAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SIMILAR AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND HOW POPPED PHRONSIE
237-126133-0007 BUT POLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL
237-126133-0008 ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSED THE POLLY'S OWN
237-126133-0009 NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED MAN SAY PAULLY WON'T YOU
237-126133-0010 OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I NEVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY LET HER COME
237-126133-0011 IS'T HE SPLENDID CRIED JASPER IN INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING UP FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT
237-126133-0012 THERE THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FOS HE HEAD
237-126133-0013 I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THINK YOU
237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE AN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSED TO JASPER'S SIDE
237-126133-0015 YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LACKING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
237-126133-0016 OH NO CROPPER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
237-126133-0017 THERE CHAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED MERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE
237-126133-0018 DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TRIN'T HER FAULT
237-126133-0019 DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS IVE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO
237-126133-0020 HOW DID HER BROTHER EVER LET HER GO
237-126133-0021 SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVED YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED IN HIGH DUNDGING JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER WHICH OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
237-126133-0025 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE DANGEROUSLY
237-134493-0000 IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BROOKSON DIED
237-134493-0001 HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELD
237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECK OR BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN GAYLY PAINTED FARMHOUSES THE GILDED WEATHER VEINS ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE EARTH FAR CURIOUSLY MADE IT AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GREY EYES DEEPLY SAT UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
237-134493-0006 THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TOWN ON BACK
237-134493-0007 ALEXANDER LET'S YOU SLEEP LAID
237-134493-0008 SHE GATHERED UP HER BRAINS
237-134493-0009 PLEASE WAIT FOR ME MUORY AIL COAXED
237-134493-0010 I NEVER SEE LOSE SIZE OVER HERE
237-134493-0011 HOW BROWN YOU'VE GOT SINCE YOU CAME HOME I WISH I HAD AN ADELAIDE TO GNAW MY ORCHARD
237-134493-0012 I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PICK CHERRRIES
237-134493-0013 INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SAYING IT
237-134493-0014 I THINK YOU'RE PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
237-134493-0015 THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL TIMIDNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
