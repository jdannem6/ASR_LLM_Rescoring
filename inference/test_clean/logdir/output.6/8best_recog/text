5683-32866-0015 WHATEVER I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
5683-32866-0016 MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU I AND SO DEEP
5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HAVE IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FEUDES
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUNTED MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND THE SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE DOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNEXCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY VAN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
5683-32866-0022 ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FEETED TAPPESTRY
5683-32866-0023 ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGED TO UTTER TIMES
5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN THE GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
5683-32866-0025 I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PROPORTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
5683-32866-0026 I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY ROUTE
5683-32866-0027 A OLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HEARSE BLOOMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029 SOMEHOW I HAD BECOME NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTO TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
5683-32879-0000 IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRUNDAN DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMAN'S FARM
5683-32879-0001 WHILE SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD A BAD NIGHT
5683-32879-0002 SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF VICTIM
5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN CHAIN DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL JEALOUS
5683-32879-0004 BUT POOR RACHEL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOICAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRIT OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
5683-32879-0005 THIS TRANSIT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGUULING OUR SENSES
5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS KNEW TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORM HERSELF
5683-32879-0007 RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYES STRUCK HER WITH THE PAINFUL SURPRISE
5683-32879-0008 I HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR RACHEL
5683-32879-0009 ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR TROUBLED IN MINE AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
5683-32879-0010 POOR RACHEL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS SHE DARE
5683-32879-0011 SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK A FEAR AND PASSION AND FLESHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH

672-122797-0024 THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALWAYS AGREEABLE
672-122797-0025 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADING IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
672-122797-0026 THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO

672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FRAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND ITS SIDE SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY AND AN END
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAIN FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGER'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORTUNE A CHEQUE
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATES PRESENT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THE LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO DETECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVED AN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREADS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE COULDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FOURTH CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIR VIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY DRAIL
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN A LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAME MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0010 WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TO TALK
6829-68769-0011 I AM RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN PICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
6829-68769-0012 I'LL SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING HIS DEMEADOR
6829-68769-0013 MAY BE SEA DATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG THE SUGGESTION OF PASSAGES
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DYING ONE WAY OR OTHER
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERES VISITORS TOM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM WORSE AN EARL REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0018 MISTER GRALF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0019 SORE WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GAZE IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A PENSION
6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STUDY GREY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERRUPTED IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT BUT I'M GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HOPELESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0025 THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LED HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW SHELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHECK ASKED KEMNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHICKENS OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A ADOPT COMPANY AND RICH
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BIT KEEP HER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY ILL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLATE BUT MARSHLL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHAAL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT YOU'M GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JALEER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN NIGHT DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND IT RUNS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRLS IS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I'M NOT ELECTION HEREANG JUST NOW
6829-68769-0042 O WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT HIM
6829-68769-0043 AND HE DESERVES A TURN IN STATES PRISON
6829-68769-0044 IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS A ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE COS BESIDES
6829-68769-0046 THEY ARE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHURLL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FOURTH CHECK AND WASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GUESTS
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASY HIS SILENCE NUDGED HIM
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS THROAT FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED JACKET FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MYSTERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORBES AGRESS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMAN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL COUNTESS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WEAK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM COMPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT WAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS RENALDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ALLOW HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH RUNNELS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSEING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUGGY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAP WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO INSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GREAT WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIR VIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAINMENT THE GUESS
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL RE PASTT WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY WHEN WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANTS WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DIVIDED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ASSISTANCE BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MIRTH CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER AS SPECIAL FAVOURITE
6829-68771-0017 THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND PATH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND OF LIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE SPECULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I AM ELIZABETH PARSONS
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CANT BE PROTESTED THE GIRL
6829-68771-0022 I ATTAIN TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS YOUR WHOM
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MATE SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAMP ROCK SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
6829-68771-0026 ELISA PARSON SHOOK HER HEAD
6829-68771-0027 THEY THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I AM I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEMED BOLDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEIST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER A NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR A SORT OF BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES RENDERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES ON FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR KEPT HER BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I WISH I NEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE ON MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLLICKED IN THE LOCK
6930-75918-0000 CONCORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTSE
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FLOWED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCE EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCIS WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITFULLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAIN THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN AN HESSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0007 IT WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS AM
6930-75918-0008 CAN YOU IMAGINE MY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO FOND I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN ROW I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0010 I CAN PERCEIVE LIVE CLEARLY ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 I AM CONVINCED OF WHATEVER I SAY SAID THE COUNT
6930-75918-0012 IS ANNOYANCE THEN
6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN HAD HAD IT MORE
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED RAWLE NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
