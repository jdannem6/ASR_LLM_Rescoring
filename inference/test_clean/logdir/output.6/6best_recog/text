5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HOPE IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY VIEWS
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STUDY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND THE SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHEWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNACCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY VAIN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
5683-32866-0022 ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FEATED TAPESTRY

5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC CORSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029 SOME HOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME PROFOUNDEDLY

5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO ACCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL JEALOUS
5683-32879-0004 BUT POOR RACHEL LEAGUE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOICAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
5683-32879-0005 THIS TRANSIT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEUILING OUR SENSES
5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS DUE TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORM HERSELF
5683-32879-0007 RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DISLATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH THE PAINFUL SURPRISE
5683-32879-0008 YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR CREATURES

5683-32879-0011 SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLESH

672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BRUISEING COPPER AND ITS SIDE SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY WAS AN END
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAIN FROM DOING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGER'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORTUNE A CHECK
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATES PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RUSH ACT
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD SQUIRE
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYRS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVE IN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETULESS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORCE CHEQUE THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIRVIW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY DRAIL
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NEED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0010 WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KNETH TALK
6829-68769-0011 I' AM RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
6829-68769-0012 I'LL SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING AS DEMEATOR
6829-68769-0013 MAYBE WE SEE DATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THE GAILER ALONG THE SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DY IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITORS CALM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM WORSE AN HOUR REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0018 MISTER GRAVE SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0019 SORE IT WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID BATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A PENSIONER
6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STUDY GRAY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO THINKING WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POUR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0025 THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEADER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK IN RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THROUGH THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHECK ASK KENNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHEQUES OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A STALK COMPANY AND RICH
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BIT KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHACK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVE HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARS SHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEILING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHIL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT I' AM GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE GAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'LL SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MY DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND IT RUINS AMAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACUOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRL HAS BEEN IN HEAR TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I'M NOT ELECTION HEARINGS NOW
6829-68769-0042 AH WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT HIM
6829-68769-0043 AND HE DESERVES THE TERM IN STATES PRESENT
6829-68769-0044 IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE COSTS BESIDES
6829-68769-0046 THEY'RE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHEL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGE CHECK AND WASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GAINS
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASINESS AS SILENCE NUDGED HIM
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHRILL FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED TRICK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNT AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORDS AGRESS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL COUNTESS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WEAK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM A OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTED FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS RENALDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ILLE HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH RUNNALS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUTGGY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAD WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN SELECTING MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE PROVED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIR VIEWAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESS
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIALREAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY WHEN WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBOURS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESS
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANTS WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR HAVING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ACQUAINTANCE BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUNN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER ESPECIALLY FAVORITE
6829-68771-0017 THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BOTH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPUSURE AND OF SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMURST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE HAT AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I AM ELIZABETH PARSONS
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE PRETENDED THE GIRL
6829-68771-0022 I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNEW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS YOUR OWN
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACES OF HER VISITOR
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP LOCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
6829-68771-0026 ELIZA PARCEL SHOOK HER HEAD
6829-68771-0027 THEY THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I YOU CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE INTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ALLIZA SURPASSED HER A NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL PRAYED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S HAND
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES OR FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH FOR BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONG IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CUCKED IN THE LOCK
6930-75918-0000 CONCORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENT
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH GOADED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED IN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGIVE FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITILY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH WEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HERSSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS HAVE
6930-75918-0008 CAN YOU IMAGINE MY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO FINE I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU WHERE MISTAKEN ROW I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0010 I CAN PERCEIVE OF CLEARLY ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SEE SAID THE COUNT
6930-75918-0012 IT IS ANNOYANCE THEM
6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VARIOUS TERMS I EVEN HAD IT MORE
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED RAWLE NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AN INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
