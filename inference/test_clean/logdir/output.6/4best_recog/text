6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAIN FROM KNOWING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGER'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORTUNE A CHECK
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM THAT TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATES PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD BOY
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEOFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVED IN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFTLY HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGE CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DARE OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIRVI WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY TRAIL
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAY MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0010 WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWER KENNETH TALK
6829-68769-0011 I M RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY

6829-68769-0013 MAY ME SEE DATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOW THE JAILER ALONG THE SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNIN FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DYING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED WHERE'S VISITORS TOM
6829-68769-0017 WORST TOM WORSE AN ERROR REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0018 MISTER GRAFT SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0019 SORRY WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM AND THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID KATE IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A PENSION
6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WITH TOM GATES WITH STEADY GREY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
6829-68769-0022 WEVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AN I'M GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 OLD WELL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0025 THEN ROBBERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEADER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN A NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHUCK ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO DESIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A STOUT COMPANY AND RICH
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BIT KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORG THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLATE BUT MARSHEL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THAT GIRL UNFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHEL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT I'M GREATFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO ENLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN WHAT DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND AT RUINS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY THAT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRL HAS BEEN INHER TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I'M NOT ELECTION HEREANGS NOW
6829-68769-0042 OH WELL SERVED WHAT ABOUT HIM
6829-68769-0043 AND HE DESERVES THE TERM IN STATES PRISONER
6829-68769-0044 IT HAS COST ME TWICE FIFTY DOLLARS AN ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE COST BESIDE
6829-68769-0046 YOU' ARE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHHALL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORCE CHECK AND WASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GAITS
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASINESS A SILENCE NUDGED HIM
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS RUDE FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHICKEN FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAY ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORTS AGRESS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HECHMENT AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVAS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WEAK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM THE OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT A AWAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS RENALDS WERE SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH RENTALDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PUGGY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEG WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSISTANCE IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE INSISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIR VIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAINMENT THE GUESTS
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTITUTE REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBOURS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDS WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTEMPTANCE BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MADES
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER A SPECIAL FAVOURITE
6829-68771-0017 THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BATH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MATE REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND OF SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MATES AT ELMHURST A PLAYING BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PARSONS
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE REQUESTED THE GIRL
6829-68771-0022 I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENNDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERES YOUR HOME
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISIT
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROLLED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
6829-68771-0026 ELIZA PERSON SHOOK HER HEAD
6829-68771-0027 THEY' THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACT IT
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELISA SURPASSED HER A NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERT OF BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES WONDERED TO THE MATE'S HANDS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FOR MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISIT TO CATCH HER BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I AM WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035 WOULD YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLUCKED IN THE LOCK
6930-75918-0000 CONCORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FLOATED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS ELSEWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UN HAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVE AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THEY COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN AN HEARSSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS HIM

6930-75918-0011 I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAYING SAID THE COUNT
6930-75918-0012 IT IS ANNOYANCE THERE
