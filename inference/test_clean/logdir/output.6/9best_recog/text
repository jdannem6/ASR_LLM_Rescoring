5683-32866-0015 WOULD I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT

5683-32866-0017 I IS VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FIELDS
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTH AND MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEWBORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND THE SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT SIEGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNECCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
5683-32866-0022 ITS COTTONS WERE OF THICK AND FEETED TAPESTRY
5683-32866-0023 ALL THE PRISONER BELONGED TO OTHER TIMES
5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN THE GOOSE STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
5683-32866-0025 I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CANOE
5683-32866-0026 I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY BRUTE
5683-32866-0027 A COLD WHITE MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HEARS PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029 SOMEHOW I HAD THROWN NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED OUT THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
5683-32879-0000 IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDAN DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMAN'S FARM
5683-32879-0001 WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD OF BAD NIGHT
5683-32879-0002 SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF VULGAR
5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THAT DREADFUL JEALOUS
5683-32879-0004 BUT POOR RACHEL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOICAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
5683-32879-0005 THIS TRANSIT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGUILLING OUR SENSES
5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FOR HERSELF
5683-32879-0007 RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISED
5683-32879-0008 YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL I POOR RACHEL
5683-32879-0009 ILL AND TRUE DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
5683-32879-0010 POOR RACHEL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUE AS SHE DARED
5683-32879-0011 SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLESHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
5683-32879-0012 FRANK YOU RACHEL MY COUSIN RACHEL MY ONLY FRIEND

672-122797-0024 HIS DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
672-122797-0025 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHERE HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
672-122797-0026 THERE TWO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BUCKS AND FULL OF TOYS WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO

672-122797-0043 WHATS THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE

672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND IT SIDE SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE ON THE STORY HAD AN END
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAIN FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGER'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORTUNE A CHICKEN
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHLY TERM IN THE STATES PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LOYAL LAWYER
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE A THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVED A A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COSTS
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FIRST CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I GUESS OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIRVIW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY DRALE
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN KNEE MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0010 WE WISHES TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TALK
6829-68769-0011 I AM RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICANT TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
6829-68769-0012 I'LL SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING AS DEMETER
6829-68769-0013 MAYBE SEE GATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONE THE SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARN IN FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DYING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITOR'S TOM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM HORSE AN ERROR REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0018 MISTER GRAUFF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0019 SOR WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A PENSIONAR
6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GETS WITH STEADY GRAY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF OUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I' AM GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT MORE AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0025 THEN ROBBERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLE BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHICKEN ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONSENT
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A STUFF COMPANY AND RICH
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BIT KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHEQUE AND FORG THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBPING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLATE BUT MARSIAL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEELING THAN COULD KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHILE SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT AM GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOGUE THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MINE DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND IT GROANS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRLS HAS BEEN INHER TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I'M NOT ELECTION HEREINGS NOW
6829-68769-0042 OH WELL WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT HIM
6829-68769-0043 AND HE DESERVES THE TERM IN STATE'S PRISON
6829-68769-0044 IT IS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS AN ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE CROSS BESIDES
6829-68769-0046 BERE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHILL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGE CHECK AND CAUTION FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG MATES
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASY AT A SILENCE NUDGEED HIM
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT IN HIS SHREWD FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED JERK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMAN OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORDS AGGRESS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVAS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WEAK NEEDED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURES OUT A WAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REGINALDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH RUNNELDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUGGING
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL WEEK WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBS
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN MEANING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIR VIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCED AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESS
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBLIME REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY WHEN WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBOURS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANTS WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESSFUL FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENDS BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDENS
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER SPECIAL FAVOR
6829-68771-0017 THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BIRTH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND OF A SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMURST A PLAYING BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAD AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PERSONS
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE TRUSTED THE GIRL
6829-68771-0022 I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD LENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHEREAS YOUR HOME
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZ WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A WALKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCK SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
6829-68771-0026 ALLIZA PARSON SHOOK HER HEAD
6829-68771-0027 THEY THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST ACCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZASA SURPASSED HER A NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTING BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES MUTTERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORMED MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH OUR BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I BELIEVE I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE AT MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A EXCITED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
6930-75918-0000 CONCORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TANKS
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FOEDED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS SOMEWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UN HAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGIVE FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FEATURE OPEN FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT HANGING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARSSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS M
6930-75918-0008 CAN YOU IMAGINE MY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO ISLAND I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU ARE MISTAKEN ROW I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0010 I CAN PERCEIVE LOVE MERELY ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 I AM COMMENCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNT
6930-75918-0012 IT IS ANNOYANCE THEY
6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VERY ARMS I EVEN HAD IT MORE
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED ROWE NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PROPOSED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AN INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
