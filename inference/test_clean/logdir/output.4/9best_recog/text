3575-170457-0034 CAN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MIND THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
3575-170457-0035 I WISH YOU WILL RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS TO THE ENDSTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
3575-170457-0036 MY EYES FILLETH TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WANDERING IN THOUGHT INDEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVONISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH
3575-170457-0037 IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDED ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR A DIRECTION
3575-170457-0038 AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF TIHOVA I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
3575-170457-0039 THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELED OUT MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SOLDIERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL HE WAS DARK AND NO ONE SAW HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
3575-170457-0042 UNFORTUNATELY THE FACTOR CANNOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT HER HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
3575-170457-0043 HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMEMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT AND MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITIES STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
3575-170457-0045 I AM NOT GREAT ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY
3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BROAD DAYS A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST SHOP IN HALL WORTH AND FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTORS IN NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBYS FRACTURE LEG
3575-170457-0047 TAUBBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO A CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
3575-170457-0049 THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
3575-170457-0050 TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFORMITY IN AGE
3575-170457-0051 AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MILL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0052 SHE HAD ANOTHER RATE ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
3575-170457-0053 BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SERVE JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCH OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0054 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPRATED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANNE STATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY IN ALL THESE HOLIDAYS SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FOND ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0056 I DOUBT WHETHER BRAND WELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SOAP TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT KNOWING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEY PLENTY AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
3729-6852-0003 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR BY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCOVERRA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERY ONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURES SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
3729-6852-0005 SYLVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIVO FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO PROSERITY
3729-6852-0006 SYLVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HERSELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARY ANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MARREVILLE AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONORABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SAVAIR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTICHRIAN INTOLERNCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPAR YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIA DIES
3729-6852-0010 I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILYLY
3729-6852-0011 I HAD A NAME I BELIEVE IN MY LONG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
3729-6852-0012 I SHALL CALL YOU A SPREREY
3729-6852-0013 YOU DO ME A GREAT ORDER
3729-6852-0014 HERE GO AND LET ME CHANGE FOR A LOUIS I HAVE IT SIR
3729-6852-0015 AFTER YOUR SERVICE SIR
3729-6852-0016 MADAME QUINCE ALL BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR INQUIRIES
3729-6852-0017 I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIRE AT THE RATE OF ONE SHOE MEN READING THE NEWSPAPER UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE OR IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE
3729-6852-0018 I SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE A WINTER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO INQUIRE MY WISHES
3729-6852-0019 I ASK HIM TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
3729-6852-0020 THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANI ME EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0021 I THANK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVES
3729-6852-0022 I ADDRESS HIM AN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
3729-6852-0023 MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT HAS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
3729-6852-0024 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE QUARTER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
3729-6852-0025 IS THERE NOT A MARREDIAN EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0026 YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYALO IS THE MOST EXACT
3729-6852-0027 THAT IS TRUE BADILPHREE
3729-6852-0028 ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GETT THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED
3729-6852-0029 IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE SAVET CAT
3729-6852-0030 IS IT BETTER THAN CATERPILLAR ELSE
3729-6852-0031 BUT TO HOW COULD SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE
3729-6852-0032 SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALLOW TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
3729-6852-0033 YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS CERTAINLY A DAUGHTER OF WHICH THE WORLD HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR SULLENNESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT
3729-6852-0034 LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MADE BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
3729-6852-0035 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH IMPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
3729-6852-0036 WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT VVE A LA ROY
3729-6852-0037 SHE INTRODUCED MY TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
3729-6852-0038 WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM AM BY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
3729-6852-0039 HE HIMSELF RECITEITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
3729-6852-0040 FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE A RAPID PROGRESS
3729-6852-0041 I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
3729-6852-0042 I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIABLE AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TODAY HIM
3729-6852-0043 I RESIDE IN THE MARREES GREW DE DUCE PORT
3729-6852-0044 I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FUNCTION YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU INSATIABLE
3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY ROUTTEES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALL ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTEENTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN SIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUS OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY EPHELIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TODAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE HAVE A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WARDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLIMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTED ORGANIZATIONS
4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PROCESSITES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BILLING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HESITATE THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW IN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THIS SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY FOR TRUTH
4077-13751-0006 THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SUN NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSULATING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
4077-13751-0007 THE BOOK A WOMAN HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK A MORMAN STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF CARTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE EERY AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVINT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES A MIZIE INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MASYRIANS
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LITTLE BURNED W BOGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMAN HADER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTED SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICICAL BY HUMAN SCRIBE
4077-13751-0014 MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CALLED WELL COUNTY THEREIN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHORE CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE TAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOUR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGN THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0017 OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW FALSE THE FACT
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBITGENSES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE FOUDOIS HUNTED AND HAUNTED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SEEINGS AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13751-0019 WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS IT THE MORMENS
4077-13751-0020 AS THE SAABLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MASYRIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF VIZOURI WITH GOVERNOR BOX AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCITED TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
4077-13754-0000 THE ARMY FOUND THE PEOPLE ON POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
4077-13754-0001 BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITIONS IN GENERAL
4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOID'S ADVICE THAT YOUCATED ORDER THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE ENTRANCE OF THE SUCCESSIONISTS
4077-13754-0003 MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHILE GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISH
4077-13754-0004 ALREADY AND NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST
4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY SAID POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN IN ARMS FOR THEIR COUNTRIES NEED
4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LATTER DAY SAINTS CALL CELESTRAL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF CELESTIAL MARRIAGE MORALITY OF WIFES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE IN A LITTLE RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED AND AUTHORIES RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO DREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE HAD MEET THE PEOPLE WHEREIN WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALIGNED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
4077-13754-0009 AT THE CONCEPTION OF GENERAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE
4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING PEARL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SET AT PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT WARMANS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
4077-13754-0012 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOUR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALITY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT IN A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE I FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTENDS SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FINE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS TRAVISTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DURATION
4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
4077-13754-0015 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ISSUED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THAT PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL A STATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE WARMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON ITS FINALLY HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
4446-2271-0000 MADE HALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0001 HE HAD PRECANCY IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS ON MECHANICS
4446-2271-0002 IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON SO
4446-2271-0003 IT'S BEEN OWN ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
4446-2271-0004 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MILL HALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANDSOME AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
4446-2271-0005 SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE'S OUT HER BEST ON THE SECONDACK
4446-2271-0006 HE'S BEEN WANTED TO MARRY HAND OF THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
4446-2271-0007 SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP OF ANYBODY YOU KNOW
4446-2271-0008 I RAINBER GOING ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
4446-2271-0009 MABEL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RABBIT EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
4446-2271-0010 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
4446-2271-0011 SIR HARRY TOWN MISTER PARKLY ALEXANDR OF THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0012 I SAY SAID HARRY THE LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
4446-2271-0013 YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE ARE BIT CONSCIOUS TO NIGHT BUT THE FIRST TIME
4446-2271-0014 WEST MERRY AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
4446-2271-0015 A LITTLE ATTACK OF ORDERS POSSIBLY
4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLLY FIELD
4446-2271-0017 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINTERFOOT WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
4446-2271-0018 SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THE WAY IM GLAD YOU ASK ME
4446-2271-0019 AFTER THE IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET
4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHALL ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY INSENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFT
4446-2271-0021 SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THITHER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO

4446-2275-0002 ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTONING AND UN BUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HOLD HIS LIVING ROOM
4446-2275-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN I ENTERED
4446-2275-0004 ALEXANDRA DID NOT SIT DOWN
4446-2275-0005 I FELT IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SLENDER WAS GOING TO TURN UP
4446-2275-0006 I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SISTER KATE HER COUSIN MARK WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG

4446-2275-0044 AND DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
4446-2275-0045 OF TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT
4507-16021-0000 CHAPTER ONE ORLEANS
4507-16021-0001 IT ENGENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LA PAG FOR WHICH RED THEFT AND A HEL LAP A GRIN FOR WHICH RED HUNGER
4507-16021-0002 THUS EVILNESSES THE MOTHER
4507-16021-0003 SHE HAS A SON THEFT IN A DAUGHTER HUNGER
4507-16021-0004 WHAT IS SPANG
4507-16021-0005 WE HAVE NOW UNDERSTOOD THIS SORT OF OBJECTIONS
4507-16021-0006 SLAG IS ODIOUS
4507-16021-0007 SLANG MIX ONE SHUDDER
4507-16021-0008 WHO ANNOYS THAT OF COURSE IT DOES
4507-16021-0009 WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF POBING A WOUND A GULF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
4507-16021-0010 WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEIOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED IN FULFILLED MERITS
4507-16021-0011 WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORED EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0012 WHAT SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
4507-16021-0013 NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMMING OF SLANG
4507-16021-0014 NOW WHEN HAS HORROR EVER EXLUDED STUDY
4507-16021-0015 SINCE WOMEN HAS MALADY BANISHED MEDICINE
4507-16021-0016 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TERRINIALA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS
4507-16021-0017 HE WOULD BE LIKE APHOLOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
4507-16021-0018 WHAT IS SLANG BRAVELY SPEAKING
4507-16021-0019 IS THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS
4507-16021-0020 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLANG
4507-16021-0021 THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTARY WHO SAYS MY SKIP OF THE GUTTER THE HAIR DRESSER WHO SAYS MY MERELY BACK THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLING
4507-16021-0022 THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PROSTUSES
4507-16021-0023 THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LOAF CLARIFIED LUMPS BASTERED COMMON BURNT THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALKS SLING
4507-16021-0024 ALGEBRA MEDICINE BATINY HAVE EACH THEIR SLANG
4507-16021-0025 TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED THE LANGUAGE OF COMBAT WHICH IS SLANG
4507-16021-0026 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVIL CIVILIZATION IS TO SERVED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO SPEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION ITSELF IT IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
4507-16021-0027 FEENICIAN VERY GOOD
4507-16021-0028 EVEN DIALECT WHAT THAT PASS
4507-16021-0029 TO THIS WE REQUIRE IN ONE WORD ONLY
4507-16021-0030 ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND SUBTLE
4507-16021-0031 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH THE VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICES PERMITTED
4507-16021-0032 HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WHERE CRAWL PELL MELL THOSE WHO BLEED IN THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO SUFFERS THOSE WHO INFLICTED IN THOSE WHO INFLICTED IN THOSE WHO INFLICT IT AND THOSE WHO INFLICTED
4507-16021-0033 DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MOUNTAINS WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
4507-16021-0034 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTEROLIST AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
4507-16021-0035 TRUE HISTORY BEING I MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLES IN EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0036 THANKS FORM ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE OTHER
4507-16021-0037 THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASKS IN NETAPHOR RAGS
4507-16021-0038 IN THECRIES IT BECOMES HORRIBLE
4507-16021-0039 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SURROUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARTICULATE WORD
4507-16021-0040 ONE THINKS ONE KEEPS HIGH DRESS TALKING
4507-16021-0041 IS UNINTELLIGIBLE IN THE DARK
4507-16021-0042 IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSED SLING
4507-16021-0043 THE EARTH IS NOT DEVOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A CHAIN
4507-16021-0044 LOOK CLOSELY AT LENGTH
4507-16021-0045 IT IS SO MADE THAT ELSEWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
4507-16021-0046 EACH DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT BEAUTY FOR ITS LITTLE CARE
4507-16021-0047 YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBE OF A SLANDER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THAN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE IN YOUR CONSCIENCE OF PUBLIC COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE OF PUBLIC COLUMN REPROACH
4507-16021-0048 THUS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO TO GOES ON
4507-16021-0049 THERE IS HARDLY ONE DAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND JOHNNY
4507-16021-0050 AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL PLACE YOU ARE HAPPY
4507-16021-0051 IN THIS WORLD EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBUE OF ANOTHER THERE ARE NO FORTUNE
4507-16021-0052 THE REAL HUMAN DECISION IS THIS THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
4507-16021-0053 TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHABBY TO AGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
4507-16021-0054 THAT IS WHY WE CRY EDUCATION SIR SCIENCE
4507-16021-0055 TO TEACH READING MEANS TO LIGHT THE FIRE EVERY SYLLABLE STUMBLED OUT SPARKLES
4507-16021-0056 HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SAID DROUET
4507-16021-0057 PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE LIKE EXCESS BURNS
4507-16021-0058 THE FAM IS THE ENEMY OF THE WING
4507-16021-0059 TO BURN WITHOUT CEASING TO FLY THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF INGENIOUS
4970-29093-0000 YOU'LL NEVER DID IT OUT OF THE MASTERR LIBRARY
4970-29093-0001 TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE OR ELSEWHERE THE PASS TO FORTUNE ARE INNUMERABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORIZON
4970-29093-0002 HE HAS NO TRADITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUIDE HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BRING AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
4970-29093-0003 THE MODEST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THRUST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF LIEUTENANT'S STRAIN OR DOCTOR KNE
4970-29093-0004 HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT ITS SHOULD BE
4970-29093-0005 SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPICIOUS PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPEL OF REPENTANCE AND IT EVEN CROSS HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME UNITED REGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALE'S VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE BULLBLE SINGS ON THE OKNITES
4970-29093-0006 WALL SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK IN THE ANDY ROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICEES WITH THE ATTENDANT HEED AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTENDED BY THE ATTENDANT REEDS
4970-29093-0007 IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT AS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
4970-29093-0008 HE POINTED TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE LADDER
4970-29093-0009 PHILIP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE AFTER LIBRARY PLAND LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED HIS GENIUS
4970-29093-0010 HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO SET INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAVEINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
4970-29093-0011 OH VERY WELL SAID GREENU TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
4970-29093-0012 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND AUGHT TO FEEL
4970-29093-0013 AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOK AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD
4970-29093-0014 WELL I'M GOING AS NEXT NEAR YOU COULD GO AS ONE
4970-29093-0015 YOU CAN BEGIN BY CAREING A ROD AND PUTTING DOWN THE FIGURES
4970-29093-0016 NO IT'S OUGHT TOO SOON
4970-29093-0017 I'VE BEEN READY TO GO ANYWHERE FOR SIXTH MONTHS
4970-29093-0018 THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALL STREET OFFICE OF HENRY'S UNCLE AND HAD TO TALK WITH THAT WIDELY OPERATOR
4970-29093-0019 THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP IN WRITING LETTERS FOR PHILIP MIGHT NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
4970-29093-0020 WHY IT'S A MISERY SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WE'LL GET A MATCH
4970-29093-0021 I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEAR IT HOME
4970-29093-0022 HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST TURNED HIS THOUGHT TO A PRACTICAL MATTER
4970-29093-0023 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FAVOR
4970-29095-0000 SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS AND
4970-29095-0001 SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TO UPON THE PIANO SAYING A SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY METALLIC VOICE AND THEN SEATING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ PHILIP'S LETTER
4970-29095-0002 WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG STUDENT LOOKING UP WITH A SHAPE OF IMPATIENCE
4970-29095-0003 I HOPE THEE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVE'S MUSIC THE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
4970-29095-0004 I HEARD FATHER TILL COUSIN ADNER THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISTLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW
