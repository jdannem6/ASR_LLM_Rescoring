6930-75918-0015 THUS IT IS THAT THE HONOUR OF THREE IS SAFE OUR COUNTRY OUR MASTERS AND OUR OWN
6930-75918-0016 YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO SAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-75918-0017 BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE ROUND COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
6930-75918-0018 THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLING AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE
6930-75918-0019 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSACHE OF JET AND YELLOW FLAG STONES
6930-75918-0020 BRAGHOON WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MENIC CAMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT
6930-76324-0000 THE LIONS MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY
6930-76324-0001 THERE WERE CERTAINLY NO MERE THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
6930-76324-0002 THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CYNDIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS
6930-76324-0003 NO WHAT IS THE SENSE OF IT TOO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT
6930-76324-0004 BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT AND HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION
6930-76324-0005 THE TWIN MOTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL
6930-76324-0006 HER'S HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME FRAME TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT
6930-76324-0007 NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHAS BRAG
6930-76324-0008 I THOUGHT WE WERE STAMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT SPIN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL
6930-76324-0009 DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MITURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING
6930-76324-0010 WHEN IN THE WORLD IS IT QUERI JOYCE
6930-76324-0011 MAY MORE ANY TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME SIN
6930-76324-0012 WILL COME AND HEAR THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON IN HALF A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING
6930-76324-0013 WE CAN'T HEARD ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL
6930-76324-0014 THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PERIL
6930-76324-0015 SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PRAMELIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PANT TO THE OUTFIT
6930-76324-0016 THE LORD PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
6930-76324-0017 OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE
6930-76324-0018 HE MAKES IT SORT OF COZ YEAR
6930-76324-0019 NAIL ITS DUST THE FURNITURE IN PICTURES
6930-76324-0020 YET LITTLE AS IT WAS THEY HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
6930-76324-0021 SURFACE MUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
6930-76324-0022 THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMOVED
6930-76324-0023 AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVE A ANY LEFT AS USUAL
6930-76324-0024 THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLEATE IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
6930-76324-0025 WHY IT'S CLEAR AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING IN
6930-76324-0026 ISN'T HE THAT GREATEST FORGETTING INTO ODD CORNERS
6930-76324-0027 FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND HURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER
6930-76324-0028 WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW CAPTURE HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0002 ON MURDER SAID A DISTANT VOICE
6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND BROOK THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
6930-81414-0004 THE STORE OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005 WELL WAS THAT
6930-81414-0006 WHAT THEN AHUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WORST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT BETTER OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CLEVER
6930-81414-0010 A SOUND OF VOICES A FLESH OF LIGHT
6930-81414-0011 A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKENED WHERE
6930-81414-0012 SAID ANOTHER VOICE WITH DIRE RECOGNISE AS FULL TEARS CAPTURE
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN THAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BY AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLOORRED
6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAAGED BEWILDERED
6930-81414-0016 BUT THAT IS CAFE OR'S KNIFE
6930-81414-0017 I KNOW HE HAS IT THIS VERY EVENING
6930-81414-0018 I NEVER SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER
6930-81414-0019 LOW CHAIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
6930-81414-0020 I SAYING YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBL THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
6930-81414-0022 I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THESE MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023 PERCHANCE TOO CAFER'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024 MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ACTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LAUGHED ME
6930-81414-0025 YOUR POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
6930-81414-0026 MY OVER ROTTEN NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
6930-81414-0027 BUT FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
7021-79730-0000 THE THREE MODES OF MANISHMENT
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTE IS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0002 BY TREASON AND AFFECTION
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SERGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AND IRREPPARABLE INJURY
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE OFFICE
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTESTEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY REJOICE PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SENT YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST PROPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE ORDERATED
7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDORECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0001 DELA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED RIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79740-0002 NOW DAMIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM AND FULL
7021-79740-0004 YOU HAVE COME AND DELLLA AND BELLAH WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S STALL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT
7021-79740-0005 AND I AM VERY GLAD
7021-79740-0006 I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANNE DELA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH FLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0009 THEY WERE NOW PLAINLY WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOUR
7021-79740-0010 DELYIA CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SET TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDDELA AND ROSILY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITIS ROOT TO THE PIAZZA THERE
7021-79740-0012 SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYINGS SEE
7021-79740-0013 BUT THESE PLAY THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
7021-79740-0014 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSE TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
7021-79759-0000 NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED MY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
7021-79759-0001 BUT THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
7021-79759-0002 THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MAY IN CHILDHOOD
7021-79759-0003 VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL PUNISHING
7021-79759-0004 WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST IN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANNCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER PROJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
7021-85628-0000 BUT ANDRS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUM FOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKIFE
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKNIFE
7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDORS
7021-85628-0005 SEEING THAT I AM SO FIND I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
7021-85628-0006 I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDORS
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK AND HER HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SHOULDERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008 FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FAR END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROSE
7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WORE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED AND GLITTERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE WOULD AND HER SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO STAY IT OFF
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAT WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014 HE ALWAYS SHOOK HIS HEAD
7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCE AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016 THAT IS A VERY FINE DROP YOU HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017 SO IT IS SAID ANDHERS
7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE MINTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP AND GOES GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020 HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALTS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH ARMS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022 AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTEN WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN GROUND HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024 AND AS FACE GREW RED
7021-85628-0025 BUT HIS MOTHER GGED HIM CLOSE
7021-85628-0026 KNOW MY LITTLE FUN SHE SAID
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED IN SILVER AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD CAUSED SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
7127-75946-0001 AH VERY WEALTH
7127-75946-0002 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLD BEAR HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF OCCOURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
7127-75946-0003 GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT AND YON AND VILE I TOOK THEIR LEAVE
7127-75946-0004 CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHICH
7127-75946-0005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED GRACE
7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHAT IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0007 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING TRAVELLED
7127-75946-0008 DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL ATTEND
7127-75946-0009 NOT AT ALL WE ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME
7127-75946-0010 YOUR MAJESTY'S PLANNED THEN IN THIS AFFAIRS IS
7127-75946-0011 IT WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
7127-75946-0012 THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF CARTRIDGERY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0014 THE QUEEN'S HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DAYS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTOREING PEACE IN ORDER SPRANG ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0016 THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRIAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ANTZ
7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLORED SILKEN HOES OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BRIANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEMED TO SOAR ALONG
7127-75946-0019 GUESS IT IS SUPPRESSED
7127-75946-0020 FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVE BEEN GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE REGAINED IT
7127-75946-0021 YES SIRE AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALLELET
7127-75946-0022 SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY' IS MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
7127-75946-0023 THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERYONE PRESENTLY
7127-75946-0024 MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT THE MATTER
7127-75946-0025 THE ALLET BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BOASTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATER SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE NAKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD STROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRIAL CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHD RIVAL
7127-75947-0000 EVERYONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BE DIMPED
7127-75947-0001 UPON THIS MADAME DEIGN TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE CONT OBSERVING

7127-75947-0006 THE PRINCESS INCLINED NO
7127-75947-0007 SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH SHE WAS SUDDENLY GOING TO DANCE
7127-75947-0008 THE HARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY
7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY SUBSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
7127-75947-0010 WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HIMSELF

7176-88083-0002 HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SALT DOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
7176-88083-0003 BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE ASELS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
7176-88083-0004 BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING COMORANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0005 ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS MARCH
7176-88083-0006 IT MIGHT HAVE SEEM THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
7176-88083-0007 BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WELL THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS IN GORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT AND SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
7176-88083-0008 IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARDS TOO SOON
7176-88083-0009 THE GREAT HAWK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO ATREE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
7176-88083-0010 THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE ON HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
7176-88083-0011 IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED VELVET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
7176-88083-0012 THE LOCK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
7176-88083-0013 LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEARS HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
7176-88083-0014 THE HAWK SAT ON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0015 ALMOST INSTANTLY HAS FORCED TO THE TOP
7176-88083-0016 STRAIGHTWAY THE LOCK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM
7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
7176-88083-0018 BUT THIS FREQUENTURE OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TONGUES WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOUT THE FUGITIVES HEAD
7176-88083-0020 WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING EACH
7176-88083-0021 BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY DOWNWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
7176-88083-0022 THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DAGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF WERE EVADED OR DECEIVED
7176-88083-0023 HE HAD A LOT OF LIE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
7176-88083-0024 THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STICKING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
7176-88083-0026 THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIKE CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
7176-88083-0027 THEN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LION
7176-92135-0000 HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A IMPOSIUM ON THE PRICE OF GOLF FALLS
7176-92135-0001 AND SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
7176-92135-0002 BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESAL DRAMAIST HAS HIS MOMENTS
7176-92135-0003 YOUR COMPLAIN MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
7176-92135-0004 FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAYING
7176-92135-0005 BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOMER GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH
7176-92135-0006 I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE BLOOD A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
7176-92135-0007 ANYHOW IT'S JEALOUSY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUE ALL RIGHT
7176-92135-0008 LIN MERE EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGE CRAFT IS
7176-92135-0009 AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HUMBLY ON SAID LOOQUY

7176-92135-0011 NOW THE OBJECT OF HIS SOLQUY IS PLAIN
7176-92135-0012 INDEED IRRESOLATION MEAN THE KEEN OUT OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SAVAGE WORKING OF THE JOB BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIC'S MEANING
7176-92135-0013 WE MODERN HOWEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT
7176-92135-0014 IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TAKE MINK HOW SHALL US SYLOPLY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
7176-92135-0015 AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN A REALLY MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTED OF THAT SORT
7176-92135-0016 THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASI TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
7176-92135-0017 AND THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS COMPENCE
7176-92135-0018 IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDRIC AND TELLS HIM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL

7176-92135-0044 BUT IT IS A CIGARETTE WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MODERN DRAMA TO ITS PRESENT STATE AT PERFECTION
7176-92135-0045 LORD JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARET CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND UPPER WAISTCOAT POCKET
7729-102255-0000 THE BOLD AS LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
7729-102255-0001 THIS WAS AT THE LARGE ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
7729-102255-0002 THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MEANLY FROM THE FREE STATES GREATLY CHANGE THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
7729-102255-0003 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NEW MIRACLE STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHY ON EXTRA ORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURNED THE SCALE
7729-102255-0004 THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE CHARACTERIAL OFFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGUS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY
7729-102255-0005 THIS WAS A FORMABLE ARRAY OF ADVANTAGES SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LOADED DISSE
7729-102255-0006 COMMON BY WAY OF THE MISERABLE RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BOARD A RUFFIAN COMPANIONSHIP AND INFLUENCES AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOULDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY ADVERSE TO THE FREE STATE CAUSE
7729-102255-0007 HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WESTPORT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS POST SLAVERY AUTHORS
7729-102255-0008 ALL THE TERRITORYIAL DIGNITARIES WERE PRESENT GOVERNOR SHANNON PRESIDED JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONIST SUPPORTING THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT CHIEF JUSTICE LECOQ DIGNIFIED THE OCCASION WITH APPROVING REMARKS

7729-102255-0010 OF THE  LENCHINGS THE MOBS AND THE MURDERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY EXTENDED WORK TO NOTE THE FREQUENT AND ATROCIOUS DETAILS
7729-102255-0011 THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SALIENT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR AND KANSIS WHICH HAPPILY ARE NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY AND A LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE
7729-102255-0012 SEVERAL HUNDRED THREE STATESMEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
7729-102255-0013 IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF IT DAY
7729-102255-0014 THE LEADERS AT THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN

7729-102255-0016 THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MOZARY MALITIA TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP OF FEDERAL TROOPS
7729-102255-0017 SHERIFF JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION BUT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY SOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
7729-102255-0018 LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME HEMMED AND BOUND IN THE MASSES OF THE VARIOUS ADVICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORYIAL OFFICIALS EVOLVED FROM THE BOGUS LAWS
7729-102255-0019 TO EMBARRASS THIS DAMAGEING EXPOSURE JUDGE LECOQ ISSUED A WRIT AGAINST THE EXTRA GOVERNOR ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT
7729-102255-0020 THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO FANCY WAS SUMMONED NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND READER FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON FLED IN DISGUISE
7729-102255-0021 BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATES MEN WERE INSURRECTIONOUS AND OUTLAWS
7729-102255-0022 FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADEED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPSON SCOUT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GIRILLA BANDS HALF PARTIS AND HALF PREDATORY

7729-102255-0040 IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATED AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSAS FINDS ITS MOST HONOURABLE AND TRIUMPHANT INDICATION
7729-102255-0041 THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISCUSS TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND ACCESSSARIES
