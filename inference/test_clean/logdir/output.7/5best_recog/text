6930-75918-0015 THUS IT IS THAT THE OWNER OF THREE IS SAVED OUR COUNTRY OUR MASTERS AND OUR OWN
6930-75918-0016 YES I NEED REPLACE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-75918-0017 BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE HOW COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
6930-75918-0018 THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STAR LIGHT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE
6930-75918-0019 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERCECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOZLEG OF JET AND YELLOW FLAG STONES
6930-75918-0020 BRAGALON WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANIC CAMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLENT SUIT
6930-76324-0000 THE LIONTH MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY
6930-76324-0001 THERE WERE CERTAINLY NO NEARLY THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
6930-76324-0002 THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CYNIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS
6930-76324-0003 NOW WHAT IS THE SENSE OF IT TOO EARNEST BABIES LIKE THAT
6930-76324-0004 BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT ON HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACEED HER COMPANION
6930-76324-0005 THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED AS PICTURE TO THE WALL
6930-76324-0006 WHERES HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME FRAME TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT
6930-76324-0007 NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHUS BRAG
6930-76324-0008 I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMBLED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT SPIN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL
6930-76324-0009 DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MINIATOR WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING
6930-76324-0010 ONE IN THE WORLD IS IT QUEER JOYCE
6930-76324-0011 MAY WORRY ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME SIN
6930-76324-0012 WILL COME AND HEAR THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOSE ON AND HALF A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING
6930-76324-0013 HE CAN'T HEARD ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL
6930-76324-0014 THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PARAR
6930-76324-0015 SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PRAMELIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUSK PANT TO THE OUTFIT
6930-76324-0016 THE LOWER PROVED TOO MUCH FORM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
6930-76324-0017 OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I DO LOVED TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE
6930-76324-0018 HE MAKES IT SORT OF COZER
6930-76324-0019 NOW ITS BEST THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES
6930-76324-0020 YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST REFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
6930-76324-0021 SURFACE DEATH AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
6930-76324-0022 THEN SHE SUDDENLY RETURNED
6930-76324-0023 AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVE'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL
6930-76324-0024 THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLELIKE IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
6930-76324-0025 WHY IT'S CLIMATE AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING IN
6930-76324-0026 IS'T HE THE GREATEST FORGETTING INTO ODD CORNERS
6930-76324-0027 FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND STIRRED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER
6930-76324-0028 WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSEM MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NO IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW CAVER HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0002 ON WHERE SAID A DISTANT VOICE
6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND SPOKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THEY WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005 WHERE WAS THAT
6930-81414-0006 ONE THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE LIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT BEGGAR OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CAPHER
6930-81414-0010 A SOUND OF VOICES A FLUSH OF LIGHT
6930-81414-0011 A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WAR
6930-81414-0012 SAID ANOTHER VOICE WITH DARK RECOGNIZE AS FULL TEARS CAPTURE
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHEN I HAD BEEN SANG OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BY AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE READ WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLORED
6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAISED BEWILDERED
6930-81414-0016 BUT THAT IS CAFPAR'S KNIFE
6930-81414-0017 I KNOW YOU HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
6930-81414-0018 I WHISPERED SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER
6930-81414-0019 O CHAIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
6930-81414-0020 I SAY YOU YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT SPLASHED INTO MY MIND
6930-81414-0022 I HAD A AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023 PERCHANCE TOO CAPTURE'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024 MY TONGUE REFUSED TO PARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME
6930-81414-0025 MY POSITION WAS TOO CAPABLE
6930-81414-0026 MY OVERWOT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
6930-81414-0027 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING INSTINCTLY
7021-79730-0000 THE THREE MOTIVES OF MANAGEMENT
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH A INSTITUTION IS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0002 BY REASON AND ACTION
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SERGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANISATIONS ON WHICH THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER CONFIDENCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICIAL
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELEASE PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL OR SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARRY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE OVERLATED
7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MOTIVES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0001 DELA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79740-0002 NOW BILLIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM INFUL
7021-79740-0004 YOU HAVE COME ANDDELA AND BELLAH WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S STALL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT
7021-79740-0005 I M VERY GLAD
7021-79740-0006 I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS YOU BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOTS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0009 THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOWLLS IN THE PARLOUR
7021-79740-0010 ELIA CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SET TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE AND DELLAH AND ROSILY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCULITIS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE
7021-79740-0012 SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLACE THINGS SEE
7021-79740-0013 PUT THESE PLAY THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM GO ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
7021-79740-0014 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUX OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
7021-79759-0000 NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY EXPRESSIONS
7021-79759-0001 THAT IS COMPARATIVELY SOMETHING
7021-79759-0002 THEY IS CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-79759-0003 VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL PERISHING
7021-79759-0004 WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST IN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESSION UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND HUNGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
7021-85628-0000 BUT AND NURSE CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUN FOUND IT I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKK KNIFE
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND AND AND OTHERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKNIFE
7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THOUGHT AND OTHERS
7021-85628-0005 SEEING THAT I AM SO BAD I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
7021-85628-0006 I AM GOING TO THE COURT BOTH ANSWERED ANDERS
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK AND HIS HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008 FOR LAKE IS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FURTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROSE
7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WORE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLIMMERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESS SET DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET AND HER SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP UPON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKE TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAT WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014 HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HAND
7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FITTED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016 THAT IS A VERY FINE CAT YOU HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017 SO IT IS SAID AND OTHERS
7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE MINTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FOR ME
7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP ANDDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020 HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HAWKS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE BRUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022 AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPENED
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAMP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024 AND HIS FACE GREW READ
7021-85628-0025 BUT HIS MOTHER HAD HIM CLOSE
7021-85628-0026 NO MY LITTLE THUMB SHE SAID
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAMP
7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD CAUSED SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
7127-75946-0001 AH VERY WILL
7127-75946-0002 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COMBEAR HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF OCCOURMP WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
7127-75946-0003 GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT AND YON AND VILLAR I TOOK THEIR LEAVE
7127-75946-0004 CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WITH
7127-75946-0005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOUIS
7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY HAVE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0007 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLIE THE KING FROWNED
7127-75946-0008 DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL ATTENTIVE

7127-75946-0011 YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM BY PRIVATE TREASURE
7127-75946-0012 THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF CULTURERY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPENING CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0014 THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT IDEAS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF STORING PEACE IN ORDER SPRANG ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0016 THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRIAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ANTS
7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLORED SILKEN HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLUSH ITSELF
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEMED TO SOAR ALONG
7127-75946-0019 YES IT IS IMPRESSED
7127-75946-0020 FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVE GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED IT

7127-75946-0023 THE THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERYONE PRESENT
7127-75946-0024 MICHEL WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
7127-75946-0025 THE BELLY BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THE THEATRE SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF THE SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKET PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD SCRROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECAME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRIAL CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
7127-75947-0000 EVERYONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BE DIMMMED
7127-75947-0001 UPON THIS MADAME DEIGNED TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE PROMPT OBSERVING

7127-75947-0008 THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM IMMORTALLY
7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
7127-75947-0010 WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIREOUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF

7176-88083-0002 HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SONG TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
7176-88083-0003 BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE ELS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
7176-88083-0004 BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CHORRANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0005 ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PURCHAS
7176-88083-0006 HE MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
7176-88083-0007 BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS INGORDED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT AND SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
7176-88083-0008 IN DESPAIR HE WHIRLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SOON
7176-88083-0009 THE GREAT HAWK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO WOULDTRIE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
7176-88083-0010 THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRICE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
7176-88083-0011 IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED GULET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
7176-88083-0012 THE HALT ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
7176-88083-0013 LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
7176-88083-0014 THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWINGING BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0015 ALMOST INSTANTLY HE IS FORCED TO THE TOP
7176-88083-0016 STRAIGHTWAY THE HUCK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM
7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE HABITS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
7176-88083-0018 BUT THIS FREQUENT SURE OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOUR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALLONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOUT THE FUGITIVES HEAD
7176-88083-0020 WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASSING REACH
7176-88083-0021 BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ARMWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
7176-88083-0022 THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARY HAD BECOME AS DOGGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
7176-88083-0023 HE HAD A LOT OF WINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
7176-88083-0024 THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPENED BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STAING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
7176-88083-0026 THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHUCK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
7176-88083-0027 THEN THE LEADER DARTED FROM THE LINE
7176-92135-0000 HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY AFTER MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A IMPOSIUM ON THE PRICE OF GULF FALLS
7176-92135-0001 IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LAND SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
7176-92135-0002 BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMAIST HAS HIS MOMENTS
7176-92135-0003 YOUR PLAN MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
7176-92135-0004 FRANKLY I CANNOT ALL ALWAYS SAY
7176-92135-0005 BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS WHOM ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH
7176-92135-0006 I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE THOUGHT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
7176-92135-0007 ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALO ALL RIGHT
7176-92135-0008 LINNE MERE EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGE CRAFT IS
7176-92135-0009 AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HUMLY ON SAID THE LOQUY
7176-92135-0010 HIM JU BE OR NOT TO BE
7176-92135-0011 NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS SOLEQUY IS PLAIN
7176-92135-0012 INDEED IRRESOLUTION MEAN THE KEEN OUT OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENCE WORKING OF THE JOB BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATICS MEANING
7176-92135-0013 WHICH MODERNS HOWEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT
7176-92135-0014 IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TAKE MEET HOW SHALL US SYLICALLY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
7176-92135-0015 AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN I REALLY MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTEE OF THAT SORT
7176-92135-0016 THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE READER THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
7176-92135-0017 AND THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS WHO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS COMPETENCE
7176-92135-0018 IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY BRINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS HIM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL
7176-92135-0019 I WANT DOUBLE NINE HULLO

7176-92135-0044 BUT IT IS THE CIGARETTE WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MONARCH DRAMA TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION
7176-92135-0045 LOWER JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND UPPER WAISTCOAT POCKET
7729-102255-0000 THE BOOKEST LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
7729-102255-0001 THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
7729-102255-0002 THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATES GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
7729-102255-0003 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE MIRACLE STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRA ORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURNED THE SCALE
7729-102255-0004 THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORYIAL OFFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGUS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILICIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY
7729-102255-0005 THIS WAS A FORMABLE ARRAY OF ADVANTAGES SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LOADED ICE
7729-102255-0006 COMMON BY WAY OF THE MUSIC RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BOARD A RUFFIAN COMPANIONSHIP AND INFLUENCES AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOULDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY ADVERSE TO THE FREE STATE CAUSE
7729-102255-0007 HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WESTPORT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS PURSE SLAVERY HONORORS
7729-102255-0008 ALL THE TERRITORYIAL DIGNITARIES WERE PRESENT GOVERNOR SHANNAN PRESIDED JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONIST SUPPORTING THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT CHIEF JUSTICE LECOQ DIGNIFIED THE OCCASION WITH APPROVING REMARKS

7729-102255-0010 OF THE LAUNCHINGS THE MOBS AND THE MURDERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY EXTENDED WORK TO NOTE THE FREQUENT AND ATROCIOUS DETAILS
7729-102255-0011 THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SALIENT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR AND CHANSAS WHICH HAPPILY ARE NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY AND A LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE
7729-102255-0012 SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE ESTATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
7729-102255-0013 IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF ITSDAY
7729-102255-0014 THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRANCY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
7729-102255-0015 ONE AT HIS MILITIA GENERALS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUT LAWS AT LAWRNS AND ELSEWHERE TO SURRENDER THE SHARP'S RIFLES ANOTHER WROTE ASKING HIM TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS AT FORT LEAVENWORTH
7729-102255-0016 THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MEZRY MILITIA TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP OF FEDERAL TROOPS
7729-102255-0017 SHERIFF JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF RIDS ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION BUT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
7729-102255-0018 LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME HEMMED AND BOUND IN THE MASSES OF THE VARIOUS DEVICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORYIAL OFFICIALS EVOLVED FROM THE BOGUS WALLS
7729-102255-0019 TO EMBARRASS THIS DAMAGING EXPOSURE JUDGE LECOQ ISSUED A WRIT AGAINST THE EXECUTION ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT
7729-102255-0020 THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO PONCY WAS SUMMONED NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND READER FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON FLED IN DISGUISE
7729-102255-0021 BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWDING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONOUS AND OUTLAWS
7729-102255-0022 FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADEED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPS AND SCOUT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GIRULLA BANDS HALF PARTISAN HALF PREDATORY
7729-102255-0023 THEIR INSTINCTIVE CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAY ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING DIFFERENCE
7729-102255-0024 THE FREE STATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAIRIE VINES WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TRUE DEFENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRESIDES
7729-102255-0025 THEIR ASSUMED CHARACTER CHANGED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES OR NECESSITES
7729-102255-0026 IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFF JONES AND LAWRENS AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EX GOVERNOR READER TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY MARSHAL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENCES AGAINST THE TERRITORYIAL AND THE UNITED STATES LAWS
7729-102255-0027 FOOTNOTE SOME WERE TO SHANNON MAY TWELVE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
7729-102255-0028 PRIVATE PERSONS WHO AT LEAST A FREE STATE HOTEL VAINLY BESOUGHT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO PRESENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY

7729-102255-0030 HE SUMMONED HALF A DOZEN MEDICINES TO JOIN HIS POSSE WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ASSISTED HIM
7729-102255-0031 HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SERGE AND TO GIVE COLOR TO HIS ERRAND MADE TO REST

7729-102255-0034 TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE SOON UNDOCEIVED

7729-102255-0036 HE PLANETED A COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANIES
7729-102255-0037 HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEAF YEAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE STATE HOTEL
7729-102255-0038 HATCHETSON WHO HAD BEEN HARANGING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GUNS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAINED THEM UPON IT
7729-102255-0039 THE INMATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNONBAS WERE FIRED TO THE STONE WALLS
7729-102255-0040 IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSES FINDS ITS MOST HONOURABLE AND TRIUMPHANT INDICATION
7729-102255-0041 THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLAN SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISCUSS TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND EXCESSARIES
7729-102255-0042 RE LOCATED FOOTNOTE GOVERNOR ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELING STOPPED AT LEXINGTON MISSISURI
7729-102255-0043 IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICER CAME WITH A REQUISITION FROM GOVERNOR SHANON AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND OF WESTPORT AND AFTERWARDS FROM THERE TO KANSAS CITY IN LEVINWORTH

7729-102255-0045 CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE
7729-102255-0046 IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINE A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PROSLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO LECOQ IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
8224-274381-0000 THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED REALISTS
8224-274381-0001 AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD HAPPIER OF MURCHISON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
8224-274381-0002 WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVEANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCALCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
8224-274381-0003 THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MON TROZEES COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CALLS IN SCOTLAND
8224-274381-0004 FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE CONVENTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL COURSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ALCO WHO LAY AT BIRTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION

8224-274381-0006 THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONROES TO ESCAPE HIM
8224-274381-0007 BY QUICK MARCHERS THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE CONVENTORS
8224-274381-0008 WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ETHEL MEN AND MOHAMMEDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
8224-274381-0009 THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROES SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNERLOCKY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
8224-274381-0010 BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNER LUCKY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT A FRIGHTENED COVENANTERS
