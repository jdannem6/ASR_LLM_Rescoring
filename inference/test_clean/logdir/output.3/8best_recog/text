237-134493-0016 ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE HE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL OSAGE OR IN CHEDES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0017 ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVINE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDER BERGSON
237-134493-0018 THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEEHIVES FROM THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES
237-134500-0000 FRANK READ ENGLISH SPELY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRYR HE GREW
237-134500-0001 MURERY SIGHED
237-134500-0002 A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING MUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0003 THE ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUNLIGHT
237-134500-0004 THAT INVITATION DEMANDED HER
237-134500-0005 OH BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE MOVED
237-134500-0006 JUST SMELL THE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPICCY AFTER A RAIN
237-134500-0007 WE NEVER HAD SO MANY OF THEM MEN HEAR BEFORE
237-134500-0008 I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WIT SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TOO
237-134500-0009 I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WHAT SEASON TWO THEN
237-134500-0010 IT'S EXCITEING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST AND TO GET THE GRASS COAT
237-134500-0011 AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOKED AT THE SPIDER RIBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
237-134500-0012 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PALE AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SIGH WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARNED
237-134500-0013 MARNY PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING RANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0014 AND A MEAL MODEED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE REINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN CHIBATA AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE COR THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
237-134500-0016 I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW THEM THINGS ARE
237-134500-0017 IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEEL THATWAY
237-134500-0018 HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INCIPID FRUIT LONG IVORY COLORED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
237-134500-0019 HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAUGH
237-134500-0020 YES DON'T YOU IT
237-134500-0021 OH EVER SO MUCH ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAYAD IN SCHOOL TEA TREE
237-134500-0022 WHEN SHE USED TO TALK ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
237-134500-0023 IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH CARD
237-134500-0024 I LIKE TO TALK TO CARLING ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE
237-134500-0025 O AIM YOU
237-134500-0026 SURELY YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF HERE
237-134500-0027 MARNE'S FACE FELL UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE
237-134500-0028 I' AM SURE ALEXANDER HELPS YOU WILL STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED
237-134500-0029 I DON'T WANT TO STAND AROUND OF BEGUN
237-134500-0030 I WANT TO BE DOING ANYTHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
237-134500-0031 SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I OUGHT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLECLOTH
237-134500-0032 TO GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
237-134500-0033 I WISH YOU WERE N'T SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
237-134500-0034 THANK YOU SHE RETURNED SHORTLY
237-134500-0035 AND YOU NEVER USED TO BE ACROSS TO ME
237-134500-0036 I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MEORY
237-134500-0037 BUT AIMIL IF I UNDERSTAND IN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
237-134500-0038 AND ANYHOW THERE' IS NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND
237-134500-0039 THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WOULD BE JUST AS THEY USED TO
237-134500-0040 I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAISE YOURSELF
237-134500-0041 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DANNED FOR IT
237-134500-0042 THAN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES OUR OVER
260-123286-0000 SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKE AN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
260-123286-0001 THE HORIZON IS EXTREMELY DISTANT
260-123286-0002 ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE DUCHESS
260-123286-0004 ONE MIGHT BE WAS LESS REASON THAN NOW
260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE WAY IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0006 WE AREIZING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT
260-123286-0007 HE CALLED THE SEA UPON AND A LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
260-123286-0008 THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT FEWS AND PROSPECTS
260-123286-0009 I TAKE THIS IS MY ANSWER AND I BELIEVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0010 SUNDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH
260-123286-0011 NOTHING KNEW WHETHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESH INS
260-123286-0012 BUT THERE SEEMED NO NO REASON OF FEAR
260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINE'D UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0014 TRULY THE SEA IS OF INFINITE WITH
260-123286-0015 IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERTERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOUR'S SLEEVE
260-123286-0017 I SHUDDER AS I RECALL ALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HAMBERRED MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0019 I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICKET HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE
260-123286-0020 TUESDAY TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH
260-123286-0021 DEARING HIS WATCH I SLEPT
260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK ABOUT ME
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERRY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
260-123286-0024 THERE'S A WAIL AWAY CRIED THE PROFESSOR
260-123286-0025 FIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTAVES ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESSED TRADES
260-123286-0026 TWO MONSTERS ONLY WERE CREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO RAPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
260-123286-0027 I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF ICHTHEISTS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COE AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
260-123286-0028 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING IN NATURALIST IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
260-123286-0029 THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTRACT EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
260-123286-0030 SUDDENLY THE ICHTHEA SORUS AND THE PLUSIOUS SOURCE DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WARPOLE EDDYING IN THE WATER
260-123286-0031 AS FOR THE ITHEOSORUS HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMERING CABRN
260-123288-0000 THE WARINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
260-123288-0001 THE WEATHER IF WE WILL USE THE TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PERVEDED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SAILING WATERS
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE TO THE DANCE CURTAIN WHICH IS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEPHANTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004 THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SKY IS CALM
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEASY TUFT OF MISS WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GRAY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAE AND A PENETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0006 THE ATMOSPHERE IS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SO CHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
260-123288-0007 THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR A FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
260-123288-0008 THERES A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
260-123288-0009 THOSE CLOUDS SEEMS AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMBMENT SAINT ELBOW'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LAD
260-123288-0011 BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SALE LOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0012 THAT WILL BE THE SAFEIST NO NO NEVER
260-123288-0013 THE PILED UP VAPOURS CONTENTS IN THE WATER AND THE AIR PUT IN A VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MIST ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WORLD WIND
260-123288-0014 HAN STIRRS NIGHT
260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL A MISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT THE ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLLICULES THE GASIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLIGHTED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSHED UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0016 I REFER TO THE THE THEMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
260-123288-0017 IS THE ATMOSPHERE CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED THE VICINITY TO BECOME FINAL
260-123288-0018 THE RAFT BEARERS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
260-123288-0019 AT NOON THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBABLES
260-123288-0020 EACH OF US ISLASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
260-123288-0021 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE YOUR HEADS
260-123288-0022 THEY MEAN TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
260-123288-0023 HE NOEDS HIS CONSENT
260-123288-0024 THE FIRE BALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHOW MOVED SOLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN ACCESS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH THE LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLING LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HAUNTS WHO FIXS HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF HATRED FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FEELS THE LONGS
260-123288-0028 YOU SUFFER STIFLING PAINS
260-123440-0000 AND HOW ADD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
260-123440-0001 POOR ALWAYS
260-123440-0002 IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WIDE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS
260-123440-0003 OH WON'T SHOULD SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
260-123440-0004 ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIMES SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TODAY
260-123440-0005 AND YESTERDAY THINGS WHEN ON JUST AS USUAL
260-123440-0006 I REMEMBER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
260-123440-0007 I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING AL LITTLE DIFFERENT
260-123440-0008 I'LL FLY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GO TO TWENTY AT THAT RIGHT
260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOMED LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JOWS
260-123440-0011 NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF IM MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
260-123440-0012 IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN DO
260-123440-0013 I M SO VERY TIRED TO BEING ALL ALONE HERE
260-123440-0014 AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT WAS
260-123440-0015 I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWUM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DRAWN IN MY OWN TEARS
260-123440-0017 THAT I'LL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE
260-123440-0018 I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OH MASS
260-123440-0019 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY EXPENDED
260-123440-0020 WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D BETTER NOT WE INDEED
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF UTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM MIND HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER ANNE OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHER AND CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY UNGOLATIONS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TEST PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0004 I WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
2830-3979-0005 THE WORK HAD TO BE CONVENCED
2830-3979-0006 A WORK SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMONARY ANGLEATIONS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD ACCOMPLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MIGILATIONS FOR INSTANCE AND
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS AND THE COURSE OF GALLATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S READINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTERS IS THERE
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOTO
2830-3979-0012 THE WORD OF OUR GUIDE SHALL STAND FOREVER
2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE RELATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF CALL
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO PRIEST
2830-3980-0003 PA CAME LATER AND HIS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF RIGHT FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISHONE HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDED HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY IN MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXELT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 PAUL TOOKS PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 PAW AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APPPOSTES
2830-3980-0011 PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APPPOSTLES WERE CALLED THEIR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD BLAME AS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONEDS THE APOSTELS FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014 THE COLD IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015 FOR PERSON AND POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016 HE SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PALL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE IN THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0019 I KNOW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SO FASTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PROUD
2830-3980-0021 IN GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE BED
2830-3980-0022 THE CLAUS SEEMED SUPERVULOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTORS OF THE RIGHTSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE PACIFIC PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CROSS WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 WORST TWO
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BRETHROM WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOUSE TO THE FALSE APPOSLES
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT A PARCEL LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACH AS I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPAL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE QUESTIONS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTORING TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE THEM BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HATH NOT SEEN NOR HERE HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE LACES HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034 THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAGMINATED
2830-3980-0035 THEY MAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIZED REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE APESSAL NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0038 GRIEF BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF GRACE AND NIECE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE GREETING OF THE APOSTOLES REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041 GRACE INVOLVES THE WEMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD RANS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVES HIS
2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRACE IN PEACE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045 MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GODS
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NONE ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND AS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WITH CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049 EMBARRASSE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY IN THE TRUE AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD IMPART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS HER DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS ARE CREEPED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL EXCCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER DOES DISPENSE GRACE IN PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATED THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE BALL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THE ORIANCE TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND IMPERFECT CREATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY AT CHRIST
2830-3980-0059 TALL STICKS TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060 HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS APOSTLE
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR CASUAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR A GOODNESS BEFORE OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063 UNDER SCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0064 HOW MAY WE OBTAIN RE MISSION OF OUR SINS
2830-3980-0065 PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAME JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINCE
2830-3980-0066 SENSE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTENCE ALSO TO FINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE CENT
2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM PRICE THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR HER SENSE
2830-3980-0070 BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHTIVE SIN
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE COULD DISMISS IN
2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN DARES OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD ANDERSON
2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT ANNE IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES INTO GOD WITH GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE WAS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICENCE IN COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM ARE SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSICALOLOGY HE REFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AN OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMATRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TOMITUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0002 IN THIS SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEW PLATANISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNEXIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATEO
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CORRECT CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE IN CONNECT ABSTRACIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004 THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TEMIUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NIOPLADISTS
2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL QUEER THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE NEW PLATTONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATEO AND INSPRED THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLAY TO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALECTS OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF HIM BESIDES THE TWORILGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009 THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TIME THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FIND THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN ANTIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011 WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE AN EXAGROUS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PITHICOREIANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THETIMIOUS
2961-960-0013 IT IS TROUBLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS SICIOUS
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TENNIS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALECS
2961-960-0016 BUT PLATEO HAS NOT THE SAME MYSTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE FEATURES OR SUPPOSE HIM
2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY FOR ART OF INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO AVAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019 HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREAT LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TOMAUS OF PLATEO WHICH CHARACTERIZES TO PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIOUS
2961-960-0021 THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPARITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLAY TO THOSE EARLIER WRITINGS
2961-960-0022 PLANTO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
2961-961-0000 SOBRITIES BEGINS THE TO MEAS WITH A SUMERY OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TO ME AS CITIZEN OF LOCRESS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER IN A STATESMAN AND TO YOU COURTEOUS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HER MOCRTIES WAS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
2961-961-0003 I WILL IF TO ME AS IT PROVES I IMPROVE
2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SO FORTIES TO A TALE OF SILENCE WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER COURTEOUS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0005 SOME POEMS OF SONG WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POOA SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0007 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HAD DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHEAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008 BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTRS
2961-961-0009 TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE'S SOLE HER THIS STORY
2961-961-0010 BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOREVER IN OUR TEMPERS
2961-961-0011 THE GENIALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANIMALS SOLEMN ARE IN YOUR CHILDREN'S STORY
2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DEAD THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
2961-961-0013 SOLEMN MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BEING INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE HE LEFT SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUND IT OURS AS OUR ANIMALS RECORD
2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST AND ALL THIS WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0016 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND HE SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS
2961-961-0017 OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CURED THE LOTOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN
2961-961-0018 THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF A TRANTICE
2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE UTTER HELEN'S HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH HAVE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT ITS TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
2961-961-0022 THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TO MEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED IN SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCED THEM TO YOU AS THE LEAST THEEIAN CITIZENS OF FROM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE
3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT POINT IN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION FAR AND STATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS CELEBRATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILITIVE CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVITIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT THE CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0003 WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE AND CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORITICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOO OR A LARGE A CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONGING TO THE LEISURE CLASS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTIALS AND MOPITIC CLEARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
3570-5694-0006 DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANCE THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME UNNERIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATES OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNANIUM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE HIS CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE PURSUER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MONSTER
3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIOTICAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELL TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONCEIVE ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF CAUSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAFFRENALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CANIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0012 THERE IS A MORALLESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK IN GRATES
3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FOR THAT BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTLEITY
3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THESE A FILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME SPECIMEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM MUST SCARCE YET ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE WRITEED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMES
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CAUSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMA WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVING TURNED ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICAR'S CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIFES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS A LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR AUSTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVAL OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0019 BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLUED
3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS A NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED A SUSPENSIBLY PREEDITARY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO BE DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMEAL LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING IN HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED ON A PERFECT CHARACTER
3570-5694-0022 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO DAILY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
3570-5695-0000 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NO CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
3570-5695-0001 THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARALLY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5695-0002 BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUKE IS OF THY CARE'S LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOW IMAGE CLASS
3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTY OF COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORALIST FOR TWO TO CIRCUMSTANCES IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF VOICEED EFFORT
3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS THERICTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY SEIZED TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0006 VERY MUCH OF SQUIRE AND DISCOMFIT WILL BE INDOED BEFORE THE LAST DRINK IT OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCYS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS IN NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO OBDICTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
3570-5695-0008 THE QUESTIONNESS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST AFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT
3570-5695-0009 EACH WILL NEVER SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0010 THE MUD AN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPECUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH MEASURE
3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVE SUBBILATIVE CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE ABILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE SANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0014 AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACES TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NAVY GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
3570-5695-0015 THE RESULT IS A GREAT MABILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME MEASURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK FAR MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE COURSE I PEACEFUL CULTURE
3570-5696-0002 ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS AFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MEN AN INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPACIOUS OBJECT OF EMELIRATION AND BUDDED IN THEIR OFFICIAL SILENT TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALK IS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0004 THE SALAND FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SETS HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REVOLUTION OF CONSPECUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOOD SORT OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMOUS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0006 AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDER TONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE DOES A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSTUMER UNDER THIS CANNON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0008 BUT IT IS ANOTHER GRAND'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT DIS CHARACTERS THUS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009 IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPECOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INDIVIDUAL PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0010 AN ARTICAL MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS CUTILITY TO THE CONCREER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARIING PROPORTIONS
3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAMP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
3575-170457-0001 WHAT ARE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER SOCIETY
3575-170457-0002 WHY ARE WE TO BE DECIDED
3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SUCH OF THE CREATOR AND IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004 WE WANT TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND RELIGION
3575-170457-0005 SHE ATORIAN CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE A VIOLENT DESCENT AND RADICALISM
3575-170457-0006 HER FEEBLE HEALTH GIVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YEAR
3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO A LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONOURED
3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SYLGA
3575-170457-0010 I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE THINGS IT IS NOT RARE
3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSENT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CUSTOM THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LAST LEADER WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
