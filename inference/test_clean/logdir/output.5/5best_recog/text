4970-29095-0007 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT COMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
4970-29095-0008 MOTHER I AM GOING TO CITY MEDICINE
4970-29095-0009 MARGUERITE BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY
4970-29095-0010 BE STEADY MEDICINE

4970-29095-0014 WAS THEE AND THY FAMILY ARE KNOWN
4970-29095-0015 IF I CAN GET PATIENT
4970-29095-0016 RUTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACE AND CONTENT AND FLUSHED IT WAS OUT NOW
4970-29095-0017 THE SIGHT SENIORS RETURNED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THE CITY
4970-29095-0018 RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIASTIC IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDING MASOLEUM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECHOING ROOMS AND NO COMFORTABLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ANYBODY
4970-29095-0019 AND THEN THERE WAS BROAD STREAK
4970-29095-0020 THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO INTO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHICIAN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCHITECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST
4970-29095-0021 BUT NEITHER SAINT GERARD NOR BROAD STREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MEANT NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING THE DECLARATION IMPRESSED THE VISITOR SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON EIGHTH STREET
4970-29095-0022 IS THEE GOING TO THE DEARLY MEETING RUTH ASKED ONE OF THE GIRLS
4970-29095-0023 I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR REPLIED THAT DIMURE PERSON
4970-29095-0024 IT HAS OCCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND IT THE SHOPS THE EXACT SHADE FOR HER NEW OPPONENT
4970-29095-0025 AND THOUGHE WON'T GO WHY SHOULD I
4970-29095-0026 IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMAN TOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE CIRCLE OF THE LEAVES
4970-29095-0027 IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLEEK LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LIE IN THE CURBSTONE AND SWEAR AT US AS WE COME OUT
4970-29095-0028 HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A ONESDAY MEETING IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
4970-29095-0029 IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KICKUPOOS
4970-29095-0030 FATHER THESE'S UNJUST TO PHILIP HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS
4970-29095-0031 HE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND SHE KNOWS FATHER THAT FORTUNES ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A NEW COUNTRY
4970-29095-0032 THAT PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY
4970-29095-0033 WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX BILLED AND PINIONED AND SHUT IN BY DISABILITIES
4970-29095-0034 WHY SHOULD I REST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN A ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL
4970-29095-0035 AND IF I HAD A FORTUNE WOULD THEY WANT ME TO LEAD A USELESS LIFE
4970-29095-0036 HAS THEE CONSULTED THY MOTHER ABOUT A CAREER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CARE OF THE WANTS
4970-29095-0037 BUT THAT WISE AND POSSIBLE WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
4970-29095-0038 RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT PHILIP HAD MADE A PUSH INTO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A AWAY FOR HIM
4992-23283-0000 BUT THE MORE FORGETFULNESS HAD THEN CONVEYED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THE FORCE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE
4992-23283-0001 MISS MILLNER'S HEALTH IS NOT GOOD
4992-23283-0002 SAID MISSUS HOPKINS A FEW MINUTES AFTER
4992-23283-0003 SO THERE IS TO ME ADDED SCAMPERED WITH A SARCASTIC NEAR
4992-23283-0004 AND YET YOU MUST ON HER BEHAVIOR HAS WARRANTED THEM HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE
4992-23283-0005 NOT THAT I KNOW OF NOT ONE MORE THAT I KNOW OF HE REPLIED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT WHAT SHE HAD INSINUATED AND YET WITH A PERFECT ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE RAW
4992-23283-0006 PERHAPS I AM MISTAKE THEN ANSWERED SHE
4992-23283-0007 TO ASK ANYTHING MORE QUESTIONS OF YOU I BELIEVE WOULD BE UNFAIR
4992-23283-0008 HE SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HER REPLY BUT AS SHE MADE NIGHT HE PROCEEDED
4992-23283-0009 OH MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODY WITH A MOST FORCIBLE ACCENT YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH SHE WOULD PARDON ME FOR INTRUSTING
4992-23283-0010 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MISS MILLY'S ELECTION OF A HUSBAND SHALL NOT DIRECT MINE
4992-23283-0011 IF SHE DOES NOT NOW HOW TO ESTIMATE HER OWN VALUE I DO
4992-23283-0012 INDEPENDENT OF HER FORTUNE SHE HAS BEAUTY TO CAPTIVATE THE HEART OF ANY MAN AND WITH ALL HER FOLLIES SHE HAS A FRANKNESS IN HER MANNER AN UNAFFECTED WISDOM IN HER THOUGHTS OF A VACITY IN HER CONVERSATION AND WITH ALL A SOFTNESS IN HER DEMEANOUR THAT MIGHT ALONE ENGAGE THE AFFECTIONS OF A MAN OF THE NICEST SENTIMENTS AND THE STRONGEST UNDERSTANDING
4992-23283-0013 MY LORD MISS MILLER'S TASTE IS NOT A DEPRIVED ONE IT IS BUT TO REFINED
4992-23283-0014 WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY THAT MISSWOODLY YOU TALK MYSTERIOUSLY
4992-23283-0015 IS SHE NOT AFRAID THAT I WILL WWART HER INCLINATIONS
4992-23283-0016 AGAIN HE SEARCHED HIS OWN THOUGHTS NOT IN EFFECTUALLY AS BEFORE
4992-23283-0017 MISS WOODLY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE AT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS AT ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MITIGATED AGAINST THEIR UNION
4992-23283-0018 TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH COURSE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME
4992-23283-0019 I WILL MAKE NO JUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD
4992-23283-0020 I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMMAND THEM TO THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG
4992-41797-0000 YES DEAD THESE FOUR YEARS AN A GOOD JOB FOR HER TWO
4992-41797-0001 WELL AS I SAY IT'S AN AWFUL QUEER WORLD THEY CLAP ALL THE BURGLARS AND DOWN THE MURDERERS AND THE LIKE BEATERS I ALWAYS THOUGHT A GENTLE REPROOF OF BE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FOR A WIFE PETER CAUSE HE PROBABLY HAS A LOT OF PROVOCATION THAT NOBODY KNOWS AND THE FIREBUGS CAN'T THINK OF THE RIGHT NAME SOMETHING LIKE SUNDAYARIES AND THE BREAKERS OF THE PIECE AND WHAT NOT AND YET THE LAW HAS NOTHING TO SAY TO A MAN LIKE HANDLORD
4992-41797-0002 GRANDFATHER WAS ALEXANDER CARRY EL L B DOCTOR OF LAWS THAT IS

4992-41797-0007 HE GAVE UP HIS POSITION AND SHUT THE FAMILY UP IN THAT TOMB OF A HOUSE SO THAT HE COULD STUDY HIS BOOKS
4992-41797-0008 MISTER PAPA EXAGGERATED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY LEFT MUCH UNSETE IN HIS NARRATIVE OF THE FAMILY AT THE HOUSE OF LORDS
4992-41797-0009 HENRY LORD WITH A DEGREE OF P H DI TO HIS CREDIT HAD BEEN PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY AT A NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE BUT HAD RESIGNED HIS POST IN ORDER TO WRITE A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC TEXT BOOKS
4992-41797-0010 ALWAYS IRRITABLE COLD INDIFFERENT HE HAD GROWN RAPIDLY MORE SO AS THE YEARS WENT ON
4992-41797-0011 WHATEVER APPEAL TO HER SENSE OF BEAUTY WAS TO RATEWAY TRANSFERRED TO PAPER OR CANVAS
4992-41797-0012 SHE IS WISE TO KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS
4992-41797-0013 SHE MAKES EFFORT AFTER EFFORT TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS AND WHEN SHE FAILS TO REPRODUCE WHAT SHE SEES SHE WORKS HERSELF INTO A FRENZEY OF GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT
4992-41797-0014 WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RABBIT DOOR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
4992-41797-0015 SIR THERE MUST BE SOME BETTER WAY OF DOING I JUST DRAW THE OUTLINE OF AN ANIMAL AND THAN I PUT HAIRS OR FEATHERS ON IT THEY HAVE NO BODIES
4992-41797-0016 THEY COULDN'T RUN HER MOVE THEY'RE JUST PAST BOARD
4992-41797-0017 HE WOULDN'T SEARCH SO DON'T WORRY REPLIED SORROW QUIETLY AND THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW THAT IT WAS SO
4992-41797-0018 THERE IN THE CEDAR HULLO THEN LIVED ALL OF LORD AN ANGRY RESENTFUL LITTLE CREATURE WEIGHED DOWN BY A FIERCE SENSE OF INJURY
4992-41797-0019 ALL OF SCORNFUL BLACK EYES MET ANTHONY'S SPARKLING BROWN ONES
4992-41797-0020 NANCY'S CURLY CHESTNUT CROP SHONE IN THE SUN AND ALL OF THICK BLACK PLATES LOOKED BLACKER BY CONTRAST
4992-41797-0021 SHE IS WONDERFUL MORE WONDERFUL THAN ANYBODY WE'VE EVER SEEN ANYWHERE AND SHE DRAWS BETTER THAN A TEACHER IN CHARLESTOWN
4992-41797-0022 SHE'S OVER THAN I AM BUT SO TINY AND SAD AND SHY THAT SHE SEEMS LIKE A CHILD
4992-41806-0000 NATTY HARMON TRIED THE KITCHEN PUMP SECRETLY SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE EVENING FOR THE WATER HAD TO RUN UPHILL ALL THE WAY FROM THE WELL TO THE KITCHEN SINK AND HE BELIEVED THIS TO BE A CONTINUAL MIRACLE THAT MIGHT GIVE OUT AT ANY MOMENT
4992-41806-0001 TO NIGHT THERE WAS NO NEED OF EXTRA HEAP AND THERE WERE GREAT CEREMONIES TO BE OBSERVED IN LIGHTING THE FIRES ON THE HEARTH STONES
4992-41806-0002 THEY BEGAN WITH THE ONE IN THE FAMILY SITTING ROOM COLONEL WILLER ROUND THURSTON MISTER AND MISSUS BILL HARMON WITH NATTY AND RUFFUS MISTER AND MISSUS PAPA WITH DIGBY AND LORRY JOY ALL STANDING IN ADMIRING GROUPS AND THRILLING WITH DELIGHT AT THE ORDER OF EVENTS
4992-41806-0003 CATHERINE WEIGHED THE TORCH TO AND FRO AS SHE RESIDED SOME BEAUTIFUL LINES WRITTEN FOR SOME SUCH PURPOSE AS THAT WHICH CALLED THEM TOGETHER TO NIGHT
4992-41806-0004 BURN FIRE BURNED FLICKERED FLICKERED FLAME
4992-41806-0005 NEXT CAME OLIVES TURNED TO HELP IN THE CEREMONIES
4992-41806-0006 WHILE THIRSTIN HAD FOUND A LINE OF LATIN FOR THEM IN HIS BELOVED HEARTS TO BE SPLENDID FOCUS FOR YOU THE HEARTH FIRESHINES
4992-41806-0007 OLIVER HAD PAINTED THE MOTTO ON A LONG NARROW PANEL OF CANVAS AND GIVING IT TO MISTER POPPHAM STOOD BY THE FIRESIDE WHILE HE DECKLY FITTED IT INTO THE PLACE PREPARED FOR IT
4992-41806-0008 PHILIP HAS ANOTHER LOVELY GIFT FOR THE YELLOW HOUSE SAID MOTHER CARRY RISING AND TO CARRY OUT THE NEXT PART OF THE PROGRAM WE SHALL HAVE TO GO IN PROCESSION UPSTAIRS TO MY BEDROOM
4992-41806-0009 EXCLAIMED BILL HARMN TO HIS WIFE AS THEY WENT THROUGH THE LIGHTED HALL
4992-41806-0010 AYIN'T THEY THE GREATEST
4992-41806-0011 MOTHER CARRY PORT COFFEE NANCY CHOCOLATE AND THE OTHER SOAP SERVED THE SANDWICHES AND CAKE DONNE AT SOME TARTS
4992-41806-0012 AT THAT MOMENT THE GENTLEMAN ENTERED BEARING A HUGE OBJECT CONCEALED BY A PACE OF GREEN FIL
4992-41806-0013 APPROACHING THE DINING TABLE HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE ARTICLE IN THE CENTER AND REMOVE THE CLOCK
4992-41806-0014 THINK SO TO MYSELF I'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING ELSE PAPA GOOD MEN IF HE TOOK TIME ENOUGH AND BLEW ENOUGH SO I CARRIED THIS LITTLE FELLER HOW IN A BUSHEL BASKET ONE NIGHT LAST MONTH AND I'VE SPENT ELEVEN EVENINGS PUTTING HIM TOGETHER
4992-41806-0015 MISSUS HARMON THOUGHT HE SANG TOO MUCH AND TOLD HER HUSBAND PRIVATELY THAT IF HE WAS A WINARY BIRD SHE SHOULD WANT TO KEEP A TABLE COVER OVER HIS HEAD MOST OF THE TIME BUT HE WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR WITH THE REST OF HIS AUDIENCE
4992-41806-0016 THE FACE OF THE MAHOGANY SHONE WITH DELIGHT AND WHY NOT WHEN IT WAS DOING EVERYTHING ALMOST EVERYTHING WITHIN THIS COPE OF A PIANO AND YET THE FAMILY HAD ENJOYED WEEKS OF GOOD NOURISHING MEALS ON WHAT HAD BEEN SAVED BY ITS EXERTIONS
4992-41806-0017 WE SHUT OUR EYES THE FLOWERS BLUE ON WE MURMUR BUT THE COURTIERS FELL WE CHOOSE THE SHADOW BUT THE SUN THAT CAST IT SHINES BEHIND US STILL
5105-28233-0000 STRENGTH OF SERVICE FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS
5105-28233-0001 HE SEEMED BORN TO PLEASE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE POWER HE POSSESSED
5105-28233-0002 IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY OBTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
5105-28233-0003 WE DON'T SPEND TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVE THEACK BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
5105-28233-0004 ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LAIDING A DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AN ENTRENCHMENT
5105-28233-0005 SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE AMONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
5105-28233-0006 NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOSE ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONTMARTRA
5105-28233-0007 BENZOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVANT AXE EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARE ON DISSIMAL OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTARTRA WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
5105-28233-0008 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SURVODOCK
5105-28233-0009 THE BOND OF UNION THUS AFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BENZIEF'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
5105-28233-0010 UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN CYCLOPEEIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPER'S TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
5105-28240-0000 FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERVE THEACK HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
5105-28240-0001 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S DEFECTITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOP MASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
5105-28240-0002 EXCLAIMED SERVE THE DECK KEEPING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT HIS TELESCOPE
5105-28240-0003 SHE IS UNDERSAIL BUT SHE IS COUNT TI MICHEL'S YACH HE WAS RIGHT
5105-28240-0004 IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE FATALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS RIFLE
5105-28240-0005 HE BECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LATE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
5105-28240-0006 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRNA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
5105-28240-0007 SERVANT ACT TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DOBRINA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
5105-28240-0008 A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RANGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD ENSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
5105-28240-0009 SLIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAIN SAIL AND IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOP SAILS BRIGANTINE AND JB
5105-28240-0010 CAPTAIN SEVEREDAK HASTENED TOWARD HIM
5105-28240-0011 I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOUR OF FINDING YOU ON AN IRELAND
5105-28240-0012 NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN WE ILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
5105-28240-0013 NOTHING MORE THEN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
5105-28240-0014 ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDDITERRANEAN
5105-28240-0015 FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPEFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THE COUNTER WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
5105-28240-0016 TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THEY COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
5105-28240-0017 SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCES SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
5105-28240-0018 YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNTER WILL YOU NOT
5105-28240-0019 MY CAT IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR AROUND THE WORLD
5105-28240-0020 THE COUNTESS SHOOK HIS HEAD
5105-28240-0021 BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DOBRENNA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
5105-28240-0022 IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHONER WERE COMPLETED
5105-28240-0023 A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S OR BED WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
5105-28240-0024 DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BENZOV TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
5105-28241-0000 HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUMNOVATION OF THE GLOBE
5105-28241-0001 AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YAT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
5105-28241-0002 THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PRECOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
5105-28241-0003 STEAM UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SCHUNNER STARTED EASTWARDS
5105-28241-0004 ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARKLE SO BUOYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF OSCILLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
5105-28241-0005 FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF JEERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
5105-28241-0006 THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK AT THE SEXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
5105-28241-0007 THERE'S NO FEAR THAT SIR
5105-28241-0008 IF THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIIT BUT SHE IS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ON TO THE SUN
5105-28241-0009 AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVANTOCK EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
5105-28241-0010 OCEAN REIGNED SUFFERING
5105-28241-0011 ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE AUGERIAN METROPOLIS
5105-28241-0012 WAS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
5105-28241-0013 WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST ELINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
5105-28241-0014 ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
5105-28241-0015 TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FORTIFILE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHEATRE
5105-28241-0016 YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF OUR JULIA AS YOU IMAGINED
5105-28241-0017 AFTER POUNDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
5105-28241-0018 ITS DEATH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARON OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
5105-28241-0019 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND TURN IN DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARD THE NORTH
5142-33396-0000 AT ANOTHER TIME HAROLD AST
5142-33396-0001 WHAT IS YOUR COUNTRY OLAF HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A THRALL THE THRONG'S EYES FLASHED

5142-33396-0013 HE IS BUT A BOY THE MEN SAID
5142-33396-0014 THIRTY MEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER RAISED THEIR SWORDS AND SAID
5142-33396-0015 AS OUR BOAT FLASHED DOWN THE ROLLERS INTO THE WATER I MADE THIS SONG AND SAYING IT
5142-33396-0016 SO WE HATED THE COAST OF NORWAY
5142-33396-0017 WE ATE IT MANY MEN'S TABLES UNENVIED
5142-33396-0018 A DRAGON'S BELLY IS NEVER FELL AND ON BOARD WENT THE GOLD
5142-33396-0019 OH IT IS BETTER TO LIVE ON A SEA AND LET OTHER MEN RAIS YOUR CROPS AND COOK YOUR MEALS
5142-33396-0020 A HOUSE SMELLS A SMOKE A SHIP SMELLS OF FROLIC
5142-33396-0021 UP AND DOWN THE WATER WE WENT TO GET MUCH WEALTH THAN MUCH FROLIC
5142-33396-0022 WHAT IS THE FARM OLOF NOT YET I ANSWERED BITKING IS BETTER FOR SUMMER
5142-33396-0023 YOU WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A FEW SPARKS ON THE HEARTH
5142-33396-0024 I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL FOR I WANTED NO SWORD REACHING OUT OF THE DARKNESS FOR ME
5142-33396-0025 COME COME I COLD WHEN NO ONE OBEYED A FIRE
5142-33396-0026 MY MEN LAUGHED YES A STINGY HOST

5142-33396-0028 ON A BENCH ON A FAR CORNER WHERE A DOZEN PEOPLE HUDDLED TOGETHER

5142-36377-0000 IT WAS ONE OF THE MASTERLY AND CHARMING STORIES OF DEM ALL THE ELDER
5142-36377-0001 IN FIVE MINUTES I WAS IN THE NEW WORLD AND MY MELANCHOLY ROOM WAS FULL OF THE LIVELIEST FRENCH COMPANY
5142-36377-0002 THE SOUND OF AN IMPERATIVE AND UNCLECOMPROMISING BELL RECALLED ME IN DUE TIME TO THE REGIONS OF REALITY
5142-36377-0003 AMBROWS MET ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND SHOWED ME THE WAY TO THE SUPPER ROOM
5142-36377-0004 SHE SIGNED TO ME WITH A GHOSTLY SOLEMNITY TO TAKE THE VACANT PLACED ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER
5142-36377-0005 THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS STILL STUDYING THE TWO BROTHERS WITHOUT I HONESTLY CONFESS BEING VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY EITHER OF THEM
5142-36377-0006 A NO MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE WHO INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED THE ROOM
5142-36377-0007 A LITTLE CRACKED THAT IN THE POPULAR PHRASE WAS MY IMPRESSION OF THE STRANGER WHO NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SUPPER ROOM
5142-36377-0008 MISTER PENCROFT THE ELDER HAVING NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FAR HIMSELF INTRODUCED NEW COMER TO ME WITH A SIDE GLANCE AT HIS SONS WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE DEFIANCE IN IT A GLANCE WHICH AS I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DEFIANCE ON THEIR SIDE BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN
5142-36377-0009 PHILIP FRANK THIS IS MY OVERLOOKER MISTER YARGO SAID THE OLD MAN FORMERLY PRESENTING US
5142-36377-0010 HE IS NOT WELL HE HAS COME OVER THE OCEAN FOR REST AND CHANGE HAS SEEN

5142-36377-0012 MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISS GEODO SIT TOGETHER
5142-36377-0013 THEY POINTEDLY DREW BACK FROM JOHN YALGO AS HE APPROACHED THE HIM TO CHAIR NEXT ME AND MOVED ROUND TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE
5142-36377-0014 A PRETTY GIRL AND SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY APPEARANCES A GOOD GIRL TOO DESCRIBING HER GENERALLY I MAY SAY THAT SHE HAD A SMALL HEAD WELL CARRIED AND WELL SET ON HER SHOULDERS BRIGHT GRAY EYES THAT LOOKED AT YOU HONESTLY AND MEANT WHAT THEY LOOKED A TRIM SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE TOO SLIGHT FOR OUR ENGLISH NOTIONS OF BEAUTY A STRONG AMERICAN ACCENT AND A RARE THING IN AMERICA A PLEASANTLY TONE VOICE WHICH MADE THE ACCIDENT AGREEABLE TO ENGLISH YEARS
5142-36377-0015 OUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE IN NINE CASES OUT A TENT THE RIGHT IMPRESSIONS
5142-36377-0016 FOR ONCE IN AWAY I PROVED A TRUE PROFIT
5142-36377-0017 THE ONLY CHEERFUL CONVERSATION WAS THE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE BETWEEN ELDER AND ME
5142-36377-0018 HE LOOKED UP AT NARROW UNDOUBTEDLY FROM HIS PLATE AND LOOKED DOWN AGAIN SLOWLY WITH A FROWN
5142-36377-0019 WHEN I ADDRESSED HIM HE ANSWERED CONSTRAININGLY
5142-36377-0020 A MORE DREARY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SAT OF A TABLE WITH
5142-36377-0021 ENVY HATRED MALICE AND UNTARITABLENESS ARE NEVER SO ESSENTIALLY DETESTABLE TO MY MIND AS WHEN THEY ARE ANIMATED BY THE SENSE OF PROPRIETY AND WORK UNDER THE SURFACE BUT FOR MY INTEREST TO MAY OWE ME AND MY OTHER INTEREST IN THE LITTLE LOVE LOOKS WHICH I NOW AND THEN SURPRISED PASSING BETWEEN HER AN AMBROWS I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAT THROUGH THAT SUPPER
5142-36377-0022 I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MISTER MEADOW CROSS'S INVALID CHAIR CUT HIM SHORTEN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WHEELED HIM OUT TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAVE
5142-36377-0023 YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT TO SAY NO EM ROSE BEGAN NEVER SMOKE WITH JOHN EGO HIS CIGARS WILL POISON YOU
5142-36377-0024 THEY ONLY SHOOK HER FOREFINGER REPROACHFULLY AT THEM AS IF THE TWO STURDDY YOUNG FARMERS HAD BEEN TWO CHILDREN
5142-36377-0025 SILAS SLUNK AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST EMBROW STOOD HIS GROUND EVIDENTLY BENT ON MAKING HIS PIECE WHEN NOW ME BEFORE HE LEFT HER SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE WAY I WALKED ASIDE TOWARD A GLASS DOOR THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM
5142-36586-0000 IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECT TO MUCH VERABILITY
5142-36586-0001 THOUGH IT IS WITH THE LOWER ANIMALS
5142-36586-0002 THE VARIABILITY OF MULTIPLY PARTS
5142-36586-0003 BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DISCUSSED WHEN WE ENTREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
5142-36586-0004 EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSIVE PARTS
5142-36600-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN ON THE GRACES OF MAN
5142-36600-0001 IN DETERMINING WHETHER TWO OR MORE ALLIED FORMS OUGHT TO BE RANK TO SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEY ARE OF PHYOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE BUT MORE ESPECIALLY WHETHER THEY ARE CONSTANT
5639-40744-0000 ELEVEN O'CLOCK HAD STRUCK IT WAS A FINE CLEAR NIGHT THERE WERE THE ONLY PERSONS ON THE ROAD AND THEY SAUNTED LEISURELY ALONG TO AVOID PAYING THE PRICE OF FATIGUE FOR THE RECREATION PROVIDED FOR THE TOLEDENS IN THE VALLEY OR ON THE BANKS OF THEIR RIVER
5639-40744-0001 SECURE AS HE THOUGHT AND THE CAREFUL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THAT CITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WELL DISPOSED INHABITANTS THE GOOD HAD ALTHOUGH WAS FAR FROM THINKING THAT ANY DISASTER COULD BEFALL HIS FAMILY
5639-40744-0002 RODE ALSO AND HIS COMPANIONS WITH THEIR FACES MUFFLED IN THEIR CLOAKS STARED RUDELY AND INSOLENTLY AT THE MOTHER THE DAUGHTER AND THE SERVANT MADE
5639-40744-0003 IN A MOMENT HE COMMUNICATED HIS THOUGHTS TO HIS COMPANIONS AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THEY RESOLVED TO TURN BACK AND CARRY YOU OFF TO PLEASE REVIVAL FOR THE RICH WHO ARE OPEN HANDED ALWAYS FIND PARASISE READY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TO CONCEIVE THIS WICKED DESIGN TO COMMUNICATE IT APPROVE IT RESULT ON RAVISH ONLY OCADIA AND TO CARRY THAT DESIGN INTO EFFECT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT
5639-40744-0004 THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS HID THEIR FACES IN THE FLAPS OF THEIR CLOAKS TURNED BACK AND SOON CAME IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PARTY WHO HAD NOT YET DONE GIVING THANKS TO GOD FOR THEIR ESCAPE FROM THOSE AUDACIOUS MEN
5639-40744-0005 FINALLY THE ONE PARTY WENT OFF EXULTING AND THE OTHER WAS LEFT IN DESOLATION AND WOOE
5639-40744-0006 REVOLVER ARRIVED AT HIS OWN HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT A LUUCADIOUS PARENTS REACHED THEIRS HEART BROKEN AND DESPAIRING
5639-40744-0007 MEANWHILE LUDOFO HAD LOCADIA SAFE IN HIS CUSTODY AND IN HIS OWN APARTMENT
5639-40744-0008 WHO DUCHESS ME AM I IN BED
5639-40744-0009 BROTHER DEAR FATHER DO YOU HEAR ME
5639-40744-0010 IT IS THE ONLY AMENDS I ASK OF YOU FOR THE RAW YOU HAVE DONE ME
5639-40744-0011 SHE FOUND THE DOOR BUT IT WAS WALKED OUTSIDE
5639-40744-0012 SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHONE IN SO BRIGHTLY THAT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COUPLE OF SOME DAMASK HANGING IN THE ROOM
5639-40744-0013 SHE SAW THAT THE BED WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE THE OTHER THAT OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN
5639-40744-0014 AMONG OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A COUNTENANCE NEAR THE WINDOW
5639-40744-0015 THIS PERSON WAS REGRETFUL WHO THOUGH HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGED HIS MIND IN THAT RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT THEM BUT WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRL
5639-40744-0016 ON THE CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM BUT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY A TEARS HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALF WAY TOWARDS HIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
5639-40744-0017 CHOKING WITH EMOTION LORCADIA MADE A SIGN TO HER PARENTS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM
5639-40744-0018 THAT WILL BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED HER FATHER IF YOUR PLANS WERE NOT LIABLE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY ORDINARY CUNNING BUT NO DOUBT THIS IMAGE HAD BEEN ALREADY MISSED BY ITS OWNER AND HE WILL HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT HE WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE PERSON HE LOCKED UP THERE
5639-40744-0019 WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO KEEP IT AND PRAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A WITNESS TO YOUR UNDOING IT WILL DENE TO INDICATE YOUR CAUSE BY ITS RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT
5639-40744-0020 THUS DID THE SHOEMAE AND RIGHT MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS
5639-40744-0021 SHE MEANWHILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PARENTS IN THE STRICTEST TO RETIREMENT NEVER LETTING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SHUTTING EVERY EYE LEST IT SHOULD READ HER MISFORTUNE IN HER FACE
5639-40744-0022 TIME ROLLED ON THE HOUR OF HER DELIVERY ARRIVED IT TOOK PLACE IN THE UTMOST SECRECY HER MOTHER TAKING UPON HER THE OFFICE OF MIDWIFTH AS SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVER SEEN
5639-40744-0023 WHEN THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS BLESSINGS WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BLESSING UPON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BORE HIM UPON THE FATHER THAT BETHOUGHT HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP SO WELL
5639-40744-0024 ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASSED ALONG A STREET IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CONCCOURSE OF HORSEMAN
5639-40744-0025 THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL AT THE SAME SPOT
5639-40744-0026 LOUIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT IN A MONTH HE AROSE FROM HIS BED AND DREWING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD
5639-40744-0027 THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIX TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONAH IS STEPHANIA WHO HAS A GENTLE WOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY IS A NATURAL AS CRUELTY AS TO MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL SHUTTING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THERE NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER LOCADIA FROM HER SWON
5639-40744-0028 I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU SIGNOR SAID DANGLARS TO FINDIA TO HER HUSBAND THE CREAM AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FAINTING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THE BOY IS YOUR GRANDSON
5639-40744-0029 THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SUN
5639-40744-0030 JUST THEN LAUCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN OUT OF BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END NEAR KADIA'S WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESSED DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONY
5639-40744-0031 SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG HER ASSURANCES THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFLAMMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES AND ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON THE STROLL WITH HER DOLEFUL THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ABDUCTION OF A GIRL WHOM WERE DOWFUL CARRIED OFF WHILST THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD
5639-40744-0032 FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WILL BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WILL DISCUSSED ME SO THAT WE MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH
5639-40744-0033 HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LET HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANDLESTICKS
5639-40744-0034 ALL ROSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER AND TRACED WITH ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
5639-40744-0035 SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOR EVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOR HER HEAD DROPPED AS SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYED STEPHAN
5639-40744-0036 HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DISTANT PROTECTOR BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEARLY MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
5639-40744-0037 NO THEN SON ON MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOU FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND THE PORTRAIT WAS A PRETENCE
5639-40744-0038 JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATIONS WERE MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR THE ACADIA GAVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS THROUGH THE HEARTS OF ALL
5639-40744-0039 WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF IN HER DOLEFUL HIS ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGED HERSELF NO SENORA HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE HUMS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN HIS SOUL
5639-40744-0040 THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WHERE THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
5639-40744-0041 NOR WAS WERE DOLEFUL LESS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF SO WONDERFUL EFFECT HE BEGGED LOCADIA TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS
5683-32865-0000 YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LATE
5683-32865-0001 SAID LORD CHILFORD ADDRESSING ME
5683-32865-0002 HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LENGTH'S SHOULDER
5683-32865-0003 THE ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS
5683-32865-0004 WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRNTON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
5683-32865-0005 BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LEIF WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
5683-32865-0006 AT DINNER LATE WAS EASY AND AMUSING
5683-32865-0007 I'M GLAD YOUD LIKE IT SAYS WILDER CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32865-0008 I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE WERE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
5683-32865-0009 AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLLELELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT
5683-32865-0010 I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ASS OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
5683-32865-0011 WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF PARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
5683-32865-0012 AND WILDER LEFT TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOR OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES UNLIKE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DARKY ONLY REMARKING
5683-32865-0013 DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HELL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
5683-32865-0014 HE'S THAT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
5683-32865-0015 I HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THEN
5683-32865-0016 OH I KNOW THAT'S LORD BRANDON
5683-32865-0017 ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LINK
5683-32866-0000 MISS LINK DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
5683-32866-0001 AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMMENTARY
5683-32866-0002 WHO DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
5683-32866-0003 IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FOUND A NEW IDEA OF HER
5683-32866-0004 BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WILDER RETURNED AND DISCUSSED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERALSHIP
5683-32866-0005 AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANDING HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32866-0006 YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HALF BEEN WORSE
5683-32866-0007 IF A FELLOW HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE HAS BEALS ABOVE AT ONCE
5683-32866-0008 BRACKTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
5683-32866-0009 I DON'T KNOW AND CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FIND GENTLEMEN TO FIND WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND HE HAS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
5683-32866-0010 WELL YOU KNOW MAYBE WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRAGTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORCAS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
5683-32866-0011 THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHERS BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID
5683-32866-0012 NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE LADIES FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING
5683-32866-0013 THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOUGHS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MATTLED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES
5683-32866-0014 DON'T INSULT ME STAND LATE BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
