GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESERT ASHES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0000)
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0001)
FOOD GATHERED IN WHAT A FOLLY OTHER WILL SOON BE BUILDED AND GIVE NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0002)
BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES BY A GREAT ATTENTION UNCONSIDEABLE EXPERIENCE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0003)
IF YOU DIPPED THE FINGER INTO THE SERVE AND APPLIED TO THE THUMB THE TENACI OF THE SERVE WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTEN BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0004)
LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0005)
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0006)
BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE WAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CAME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0007)
FOURTEEN OR NINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0008)
BORE THEM UP THREE THEY SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE THAT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0009)
THE RECENT EFFORT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING CAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACCENT OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0010)
FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FIRST BY SIRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0011)
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOW OR UP AND ON A SEED AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH PATTERN CHILDREN BEING SEATED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEIR TURNED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0012)
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND WOMENSHIPS ARE PRESERVED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0013)
MARVELADES GEMS AND FRUIT PACES OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0014)
MARLIES AND JAMES DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE POP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RHINES WITH SUGAR	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0015)
THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0016)
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAIN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBUTE UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0017)
CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0018)
IN SPEAKING OF CONFESSIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBSRS AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOY WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMES WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATINWARD COMPOSE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM COMPLEXIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY COUSINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0019)
A THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD WE PURCHASE FROM THE INSPECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0020)
HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE RAIN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGEES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERTS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0021)
THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0022)
ICES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0023)
AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0024)
THE BATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0025)
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR PAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THESE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE IN DISPOSITION	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0026)
THERE WAS ONCE TILL THE TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0000)
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO HER HIS OWN BREAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0001)
BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FEARED WORSE THAN WORSE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0002)
KISS ME GO SAID ADD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0003)
WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0004)
THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0005)
AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0006)
WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0007)
WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0008)
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LET HER A BRUSH	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0009)
SHE BENT VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0010)
OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SENDING STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH A COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNLAPPED	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0011)
I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEY NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0012)
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0013)
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0014)
WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVENFOLDS ASKED THE KING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0000)
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORD TO WASH THE FOLKS AND THAT HE COULD DO WELL ENOUGH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0001)
HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0002)
YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0003)
HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0004)
WHEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PUBLISHED HIS BROTHER	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0005)
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOOLS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE MISCHIEF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0006)
COMMANDER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME CALL YOUR HAIR	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0007)
THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE HOLES WERE OVER THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLIFF OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0008)
SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0009)
ON THE THIRD DAY SAID THE LAD WANTED TO SET OUT	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0010)
THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0011)
I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SIR TO A PLACE SAID CINDELAD	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0012)
I WOULD MUST RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDER LAD	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0013)

TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO THAT LIKE SOULS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0003)
MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0004)
THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0005)
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0006)
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD RESTRAIN HIM FROM THAT FATHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0007)
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0008)
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0009)
THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0010)
REQUEST HER FOR ACT TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0011)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID CURFERAC	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0012)
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0013)
SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0014)
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND BY BOOTS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0015)
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0016)
NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WE DO AFTER THAT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0017)
DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0018)
IT IS BADLY PAIN WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0019)
THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0020)
HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCH MAKERS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0021)
HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0022)
HULLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0023)
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0024)
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0025)
THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOU VERY SLOWLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0026)
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FOR THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD AND THE SEALED BOX	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0027)
MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH THE RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0028)
AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0029)
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0000)
BEFORE HER HE DESIRES TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0001)
THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE ASCENDING AS KAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0002)
WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0003)
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0004)
AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT OF THE SIGH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0005)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0006)
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALATRICIAN NERVOUS AND SO LONG	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0007)
THE QUESTION SAYS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TO BOOK THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN AND TRADITION	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0008)
YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THIS ALREADY PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0009)
BEG PARDON IS THE HOUSEKEEPER DONE IT OR SHALL HAVE THE DRIVER ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0010)
HE ASKED AH IT IS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0011)
BUT WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0012)
AND HOW ABOUT IT TO HER RUN ASKED THE FAIR DAUGHTER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0013)
WHAT IS WANTED AS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING TRADITION ENOUGH A LOWERING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0014)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0015)
BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING AT REMINISCENCE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0016)
AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE SAID	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0017)
AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN CARS ARE MISCHIEVOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0018)
GO TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0019)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING IF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM THEY PITIED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0020)
OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0021)
AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO GUINEA	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0022)
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0023)
SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0024)
EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0025)
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU HAVE ASKED ME THE SAME THING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0026)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0027)
NERVOUS ERABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KATY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0028)
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICLY EXPLAINED THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0029)
AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0030)
FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FATE IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0031)
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD DONE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0032)
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHAT SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0033)
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIPLE THE EVER GREWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL WAR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0000)
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0001)
IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0002)
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0003)
THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0004)
THE BASE IS IF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0005)
THE POSSIBILITY OF BLIND BODY VIANCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0006)
THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CAUSES OF THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0007)
THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IT IS THE BASIS OF POWER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0008)
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND OMEN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER OF SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0009)
INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0010)
ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0011)
BUT SAYS THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0012)
EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AND FORTY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESSENED THE VIOLENT OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0013)
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND A LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0014)
IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0015)
AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STAKE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES OF	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0016)
BUT THIS TRACIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0017)
INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIAN INDIVIDUALS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0018)
GOVERN AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0019)
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP THE FURTEST LINE BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH GOLDEN KNIGHTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0020)
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS HAS BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0021)
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0022)
FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE USE OF AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS IT DISPROVE HIS POSITION DEPOSITLY CONFIRMS IT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE IN SUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG ON PINCCOTANTS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE DRINK OF THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0024)
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSIONS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGED SWIFTS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE REPUTS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0025)
THE MEANING OF COULDRIVY SPEECH PUT INTO PLAN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THESE SLAVES TOILING MASSES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0026)
AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0027)
BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GIVEN THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS I SPORTING THEIR SUCH AS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS AND SLAVE SUBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0028)
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0029)
THIS INCREASE IS CONDAGIOUS AS MASKEW POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0030)
EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SORT OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0031)
THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0032)
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE THE UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS WHO IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0033)
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN IMPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0034)
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0035)
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORIOUS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0036)
BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0037)
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRENGTH SUBSTITUTEING STRIKE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0038)
THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0039)
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF THY SOCIAL LIKE VEIN AND FRUITLESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0040)
BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0041)
GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0042)
THERE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0043)
AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0044)
I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF ESTATES AND MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0045)
EXCEPT WITH THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0046)
WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONA AND MORAL INFLUENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0047)
SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STAINED VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL SPOUSE PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER KNOW	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0048)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0049)
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0050)
THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0051)
THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE THE DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETYS ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSS FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0052)
WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE INSLAYED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0053)
THE GOVERNMENT IS TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATE WHO MIGHT HIS LABELS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0054)
AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSAND PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0055)
THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0056)
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0057)
TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AN EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0058)
SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0059)
FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0060)
SAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0000)
CHRIST LOOKED FROM INDICATED FLASH LIKE TO A CARD JACK CAN SPARK PLUG	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0001)

CHRISTASSED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THEY HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND ENLIGHTENED A LITTLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0007)
THINK YOU REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0008)
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRISTED INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0009)
LIKE EXPRESSION CHANGED AT WHAT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT EMBRAC WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0010)
