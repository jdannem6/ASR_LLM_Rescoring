7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND NOVELOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SEEKS
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD MONTH
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HADTH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINBAD THE SAME AND HAD RELIGHTED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEEL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINBAED THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAED THE SAME IN
7018-75789-0026 NO I COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROPHET I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DIE AND NAUGHT AND I CARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SULLEN SENSE SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SALE THE SISE AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HE AND YOU THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN WILES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BASSURA TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FORESE AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TAUGHT HIM IN HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS ENOUGH TO TAKE IN REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SIGHT IN THE STERN CLIMBED TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LIFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FIST AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BID
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SAID AN ASSASSIN WETTERED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WIDING A SHORT TIME SMELLED ANDTICED IT AND THEN HE TOOK CAT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING NO ARE YE PASSAGES THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENUTTING THAT WHO SIR COME TIED I SHALL SURELY DIE WITH THAT TYPE OF A SCIPPOLATE FOR THAT THIS ASSERTION IS COLD THE SEA OF THE CRIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SIPPOCRA OF OUR LORD'S SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BARTH BE PACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH READ ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NEITHER MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH RISE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT RIIF THE HORN OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL IN EVERYTHING UNBORN WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OUR MISCONCEPTION AS THE CLAVIER BEST GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY BECOMING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN EQUITAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE REACHED THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ANY IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SPITE OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 I HAD LONG BY THEN ON THE EVE OF A VIOLATION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTEING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITH HELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE

7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND SONYA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I WILL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESSIT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NOW HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE HE WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD NOT ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE CAKE HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORTEST OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL A MORNING AND MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT SIGNAL FOR HELP LOSS OF BOTH CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL

7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE DID NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DUELLERS AND THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEEK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL AND TWO PLACE
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PARSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THAT HAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MADE DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS

7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHERY STROKELY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM THE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GUARD TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TONGER TEEL THE BOY WHO HELPS THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID DANDY CALL MISTER DEAR FATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF LOOKING OVER THIS NAUGHTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON

7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM NOW
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOTOWS AGAINST STONEWORK AND GRAHAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MANSHIP INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 ROOM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HER SURPRISE

7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM ABOUT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE ENEMY PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED JERK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT IT ONE OF THE BOWS LABOUR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS IN GRADING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GREAT AND EAGER SELLING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH

7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SIGNED PERSECUTERS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DAY OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TYPE WAS A DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISON BELL SHE WENT WAVERLY WHERE SHE WAS HANDED CONTINUALLY
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT LONDON WEAKLY

7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPHERD REDMOCKERS AND BUD PANTS WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH CONTRARY
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAY WAS A COMPANY BUFFALO'S HEAD JUDGEMAN PLAYING THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
