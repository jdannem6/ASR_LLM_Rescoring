7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN I MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEEL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW IN SHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NINE
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HADTH REACHED ME A AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINBAD THE SAME AND HAD RELIGHTED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFAIL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINBAED THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAGGED THE SAME IN
7018-75789-0026 NO I COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROPHET I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DIE AND NAUGHT AND I CARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOULLESS SENSE SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SALE THE SISE AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HE AND YOU THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN WILES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRIBE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BASSURA TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FORESE AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TAUGHT HIM IN HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS ENOUGH TO TAKE IN REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SIGHT IN THE STERN CLIMBED TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LIFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BED
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SAID AN ASSASSIN WETTERED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WIDING A SHORT TIME SMELLED ANDTICED IT AND THEN HE TOOK CAT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING NO ARE YE PASSAGES BUT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENUTTING THAT WHO SIR COME TIED I SHALL SURELY DIE WITH THAT TYPE OF A SCIPPOLATE FOR THAT THIS ASSERTION IS COLD THE SEA OF THE CRIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SIPPOCRA OF OUR LORD'S SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BARTHBY PACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH WRITE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NOR MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH RISE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT RACE THE HORN OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL IN EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OUR MISCONCEPTION AS THE LATTER BEST GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INVENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINED A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 VICTORY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE REACHED THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ANY IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SPITE OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF GLEMACY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 I HAD LONG BY THEN ON THE EVE OF A DIOLEXION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTEING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITH HELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE SOCIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND TO TAKE MACHINES IN WHITE HALL AND DAWNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTERS
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR BERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A THAT LIKE HUSH

7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHY STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY A GAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOR PROPER AS THE PRINCE CALLED OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RACE STROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISSER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND JULIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYING WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS CITY OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NOW HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD NOT ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORE TASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL A MORNING THAN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT SIGNAL FOR HELP MOST OF BOTH CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SOW
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTLE PIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER RAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO IT WAS TOO BAD HE CAN NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOES WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEEK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL AND TWO CLASSES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PURSE'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THEY HAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE I DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS

7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE ANYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW TO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHWAY STROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE FELT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GUARD TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TONGREW TEL THE BOY WHO HELPS THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID DANDY CALL MISTER GRANDFATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS NY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AN I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE REVES OF SMOKE

7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DONE
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOTOWS AGAINST STONE WORK AND GRAHAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MANSHIP INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 ROME WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 LOW HE SAID WHO ARE YOU

7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THAT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE CHINESE PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVE JERK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT IT ONE OF THE BOWS LABOUR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRADING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GREAT AND EAR AS SELLING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH

7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS PERCEIVER FOR STOW OF INDEPENDENCE WAS A DAUGHTER OF RICHARD PROSTO WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL AND JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED IN MY GRANDFATHER FOR STYLES AND ASSISTANCE
7975-280057-0003 I CANNOT REMEMBER WHERE I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SHEEP
7975-280057-0004 MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE IN ROBERT IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
7975-280057-0005 MY OLDEST BROTHER RICHARD DIED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY

7975-280057-0014 BUT SHE FAILED TO FIND THE COMFORT SHE SOUGHT FOR ANNOYANCES CONTINUED IN A MORE AGRAVATED FORM
7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SIGHING PERSECUTERS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DAY OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS A DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISON BILL SHE WENT TO WAVERLEY WHERE SHE WAS HANDED CONTINUALLY
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT IT LONDON WEAKLY

7975-280063-0006 JAGMEN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASON MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FALK WOULD LET A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPT AT THE PIECES
7975-280063-0007 WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WHERE HELPLESS HAD THE FIGHT MEN PRESSED
7975-280063-0008 THEY DID MARK MY CLOTHES IN ONE OF TWO PLACES HOWEVER

7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK REPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS HAS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPHERD RED MOCKERS AND BUD PANTS WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH CONTRARY
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAY WAS A COMPANY BUCKLETS YET JUDGEMENT PLAYING THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
7975-280076-0003 THE WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIAL AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
