7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN VILES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRIED AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BASSURA TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FORESE AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TAUGHT HIM IN HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS ENOUGH TO TAKE IN REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SIGHT IN THE STAND CLIMBED TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LIFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSAGES AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BID

7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS THE BROTHER BEST GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY SEMI A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THEIR JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AN INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENSE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ANY IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SPITE OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF GLEMACY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 I HAD LONG BY THEN ON THE EVE OF A DIALEXION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTEING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITH HELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE

7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJUREED AMOR PROPER AS THE PRINCE CALLED OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RACE STROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA ABRUPTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND SYLVIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I' WILL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SIT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP IT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NOW HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KEY HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORE TASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL A MORNING THAT MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT SIGNAL FOR HELP LOSS OF BOTH CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE CELL

7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BIG HE COULD NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DUELLERS AND THE HOES WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEEK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST A WALL AND TWO PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THAT I WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIND DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS

7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW TO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHER RACE STROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM BE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GUARD TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TONGURE TEEL THE BOY WHO HELPS THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID ANDDY CALL MISTER GRANDFATHER

7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMOKEERS DARED NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND GRAHAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 ROOM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FOR HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HULLO HE SAID HORA YOU

7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE CHIMNEY PRESENTED HIMSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVE DIRT GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BOWS LABOUR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GREAT AND EAR IS SELLING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND BRUSHED BACK THE DIRT INTO A SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA LAUGHED THE BOY YEARINGLY

7975-280057-0000 THESE FACTORS WERE SOON TO MY TROUBLE FOR ME OF WHICH I HAD NEVER DREAMED
7975-280057-0001 HENRY WASHINGTON HUNGER MY FATHER REPRESENTED JACKSON COUNTY THREE TIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS ALSO A JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT
7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS PERCEIVER FOR STOW OF INDEPENDENCE WAS A DAUGHTER OF RICHRISTO WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL AND JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED IN MY GRANDFATHER FOR STYLES AND SISTERS
7975-280057-0003 I CANNOT REMEMBER WHERE I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SHOOT
7975-280057-0004 MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT AND DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
7975-280057-0005 MY ELDEST BROTHER RICHER DID IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY

7975-280057-0014 BUT SHE FAILED TO FOUND THE COMFORT SHE SOUGHT FOR ANNOYANCES CONTINUED IN A MORE AGGRAVATED FORM
7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SIGNED PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DAY OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TIGHT WAS A DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISON BILL SHE WENT WAVERLEY WHERE SHE WAS HANDED CONTINUALLY
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT LUFTON WEAKLY

7975-280063-0006 JAGMEN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASON MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FALLS TO LET A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPT AT THE PIECES
7975-280063-0007 WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION MORE HELPLESS HAD THE FIGHT BEEN PRESSED
7975-280063-0008 THEY DID MARCH MY CLOTHES AND ONE OR TWO PLACES HOWEVER

7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPHERD RED MOCKERS AND BUD PANTS WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH CONTRILL
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAY WAS A COMPANY BUFFALO'S HEAD JUDGEMA PLAYING THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATELY
7975-280076-0003 THE WAR WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST TO ACCUSE US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
