5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS A MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DIVISION ABOVE FLARE OFF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SIRG EVEN OF IT EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET IT OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET IT IN THE MARTIAN IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARILY TO SECURE VIRAT'S LIKE TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLAROZIGHT TO VOTE THEY WAS DECIDED ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LIVING FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM GATHER RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS ADDED THE FRESHMAN BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GLEE WAS GOOD RAIDER WHO SHORTEST GONE FOR THE OTHER YOUNG WHO WAS AND WAS JARRED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP MAPKINS PROPERLY

5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHALL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY FOUR HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LED THEM SERVE

5442-41169-0024 YOUR MERIT I HEARD SAID THE LANDORLA
5442-41169-0025 YES EXHALD A STRANGE WHO WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LANDOR HAD CHUCKLED UP IN HIS WHITE MOUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN OUR BOX FOR DOOMS
5442-41169-0028 SAID HEAVEN RETURNING TO HER THOUGHT THAT LET'S STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE IS A CLASS INSTINCT TO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND ART NO TO DO

5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A REDUCED TO ADD A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FOR THE BATH PROMISED VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HEERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS TROUBLE AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUFRAINEER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE AGAIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISHUS OPPOSITION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHMY AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT HEARING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE JIMMETRE MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTTILAS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS A DOUBT WHICH HAD REALIZED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE LABOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED AN IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF A CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GREMATIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN SIDE WHICH AFI HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATION OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT IS BLINDNESS TO BEAR HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMAN TO WHOM NO TAB ON HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 TRADES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HEROD NIGHTCO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENO'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL JAMES'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LUSSMAICUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED ARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND ILLEGIOUS AND TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTICE ODDS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HEPOS AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMAIN TESTS THE LEG CHRYCIPUS IN THE ADMIRABLE PROGRESS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEADED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FULL LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISE WORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ALSO TO KNOW IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST BREAD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SOMEONE YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED SHERMANN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENEAU HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN ROADS
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEIA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HARMON LISTENED TO THE PARENTS SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENAL ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CANISTURE OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATES HER MON'S FELLOW STUDENT ASK THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HISIMATOR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED A FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO EARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKE LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMANN'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREEDING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION AND SNAWS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT MERRY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND IF YOU DIE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HARMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS ROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISONER AT THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOT
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LOVE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEBT TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 ARE HE NOT TO GREET HIS SET AN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM OUR HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AVOID HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HEARMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS BURTELS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS A FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT ESSENCE NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET THERE WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST PACE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HOME HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 BLASI WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMAND IN GENERAL PHILIPIS HER FATHER'S GUESSED WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HAROON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAIL TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREASUREOUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAFTLY AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIP WAS SILENCED HARD WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH IN COHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASS HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MANILE DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHTING GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE POSTURE THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAS LOVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 TAPMMY EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HEREUPON WITH TROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORE I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAFT YOU RAISED YOUR FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE TOMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTAS

5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY IN HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN RESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINAS THE RADIAN CHRYCIPUS AND PROQUES HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM WON LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBPED ALMOST TO BURSTING

5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH IT JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FEASTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS CORCING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDEDRED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GUARD LANDED THEIR CHIEFS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HAREMON
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATEULOUS AND JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HAIR ON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETEOUR HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
