5442-41168-0004 WE SHED OUR BREAD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH THE NO SHAKING THE ACONS OF THE MARTIAN HE'S NOT A GASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTS PLEASE BE REASON
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACCABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS A MATTER AND HE MARVELLED OF THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOVE FLARE OFF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SIRG EVEN OF IT EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET IT OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET IT IN THE MARTIAN IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARILY TO SECURE VIRAT'S LIKE TO VOTE THAT TO SECURED THE RECOGNITION OF FLAROZIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM GETTER RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WEIGHTERS AT THE FRESHMEN BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GLEE WAS GOOD RAIDER WHO SHORTEST GONE FOR THE OTHER YOUNG WAS AND WAS JARRED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKIN'S PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LIVING ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE DONE TO SUCH A EVEN IMAGE WITH THE QUESTION WE ARE MURRY TO PUT IT

5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHALL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ORDER HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DISSERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE

5442-41169-0013 THEY'RE PROPRIETORS OF THE SOUGHT BUT WE ARE THE LANDONERS
5442-41169-0014 THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LETTER MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LEAN OUT TO GARDEN FLAMING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNEW AND THEY YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD THE CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNAWED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T COME DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT TWO BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SHEEP

5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES'T
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE ST UPON MISS LIVEAGE EVER THINGS WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT TO YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'VE CUT DOWN THE LIGHTRY
5442-41169-0023 HERE ARE FEW THOUSANDS OF LINES AND EACH WOULD MAKE DO OF GOOD BARRELS A BACH
5442-41169-0024 YOUR MERIT IHOOD SAID THE LANDAULA
5442-41169-0025 YES EXALT STRANGE WHO WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LANDOR HAD CHUCKLED UP IN HIS WHITE AND DASHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN OUR BOX FOR DOOMING
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO HER THOUGHT THAT LET'S SHOCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE IS A CLASS STINGED TO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS DO I WANDERED UP THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD DOESN'T TRY TO STAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT ADDITION TO ADD A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FOR THE BATH PRACTICE VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HEROMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS TROUBLE AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUFINEER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLIE HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO LANQUISH'S OPPOSITION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASSED WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNEY AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT JOURNEY FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE JIMMETOUR MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILLUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS A DOUBT WHICH HAD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF A CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMALTIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN SIDE WHICH A HE HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATION OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT IS BLINDNESS TO BURNED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMAN TO WHOM NO TYPE ON HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CREATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HEROD KNIGHTCO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENAU'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAM'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LASSMAICUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HEARTON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND ILLEGIOUS AND TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTICE ODDS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HEPAS AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES I HEAR AIMANTUS THE LEG CHRYCIPUS IN THE ADMIRABLE PROGRESS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE RELIEVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FULL LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISE WORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARTHUR TO KNOW IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST RED CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HEERMANN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINDED HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENAU HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN ROADS
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND AL THEIA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMON LISTENED TO THE APPARENT SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENAL ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONISTURE OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATES HER AUNT'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HISIMATOR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES SUCCEED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO EARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS A DEMAND SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HER MAN'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CREATING AUGUST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO ALLOWED A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ALL YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION AND SNAOWS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE OUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HARMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS ROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON AT THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BOX
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEBT TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO READ HIS SET AN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID HE NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FAULT
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATIONS CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS VIRTUES AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT EMISSES NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET I WAS NO ALLUSIONS THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME AND ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERUOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 BLASLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMAND IN GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUESSED WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HARRYON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOW THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAIL TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL PROFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAFTY AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIP WAS SILENCED HARD WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH IN COHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURNED THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CAST HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP GENTLE DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHTING GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTIST IN THE POSTURE THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED TO ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 TAPNEY EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT WHEREUPON WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN AFTER YOU RAISED YOUR FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE TAMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTOES
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE OR ADEAL AGAIN AWAKES YOU
5484-24318-0025 AN I FOOL BLINDED AWESTORN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALAY IT NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SOAR CAUSE INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE DAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY IN HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN RESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINAS THE RADIAN CHRYCIPUS AND PROCLAS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM THE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HARD THROBED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN AFTERNES'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM WAS SEATED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH IT'S JUST DO
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FEASTILE PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS CORCING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDEDRED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHIEFS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HAREMON
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATELESS AND JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERE ON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATION OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MORTALS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THE NOBLE FEAST TILL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 OFF TO IT IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LANCE AND DOVES AND AT THE EXCHANGE FOR OR IN ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THESE GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
