3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DREAMS AT ONE SHROUD ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAUSON
3997-180294-0018 WHENEVER REACHED HOME I WAS IN THE STATE OF MAGATY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES HIM MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 HOW
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED ITS JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT

3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRE AND INCONCEIABLE LOVES

4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEANTIME FRY JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BUTTON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS THAT UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE QUOTE OF ASURE BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS RING THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHOW DUREST EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARBED

4198-61336-0007 THE SHIFTY MAN TO ILLU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHOW DORIZ WOULD RECOVER A STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADED NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGRATH BUT LEISURE HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERNLAND WHERE HE MEANT WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE

4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HEBREWS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE ZADIG
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN SYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MADEAL EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 GEO ASH THE GRANDSONO JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY CHALUM
4198-61336-0015 THIS USUR PERHAPS WAY AT SAMARIA FALLING A MONTH
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MANY HE THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TAKE LAST PLACER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVER THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT TO THIS WOOD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HAND DRAW
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS HERE TOO CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED AND NEVER REGAINED IT FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TO GLAD LOUISER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MANY HUMAN KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PECCAHIA
4198-61336-0022 JUHA HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLITIES AND CRIME
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAY AT THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEKING ME A YE TO LIVE HAVE HE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

4198-61336-0028 THE FAIRESTINGS AND THEIR ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 HE INVADES BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 A KINGER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITAL SHAPELIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVISHED AND DESPOILT
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE ANNE DURTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THIS FEST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SAID AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES ABOUT WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME MIRROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THERE FOR MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BEND NAILO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR FEW GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRY SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOURITE OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISE WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELY UPON HIS FAVOURITE TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST LUSTRH'S EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHY HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LET ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ENDALS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMARTS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMEN GEORGIO DE QUARTON OF FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GAGO CAME FOR THEM HIS HEALTH
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIED TO BRING ME INTO THIS GRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNATONA WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND MONTONI LANDEY WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THENARDIER
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CANNOT PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR NEW GALSSANDRA WHICH IS STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE HONOR KING FRANCES OF FRANCES OF FRANCES OF FRANCES OF FRANCES THANKS TO TRY TO MAKE FOR YOU VERY CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME WITH THE EXCLUSION OF CORAL STATUS OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTURE'S CRAFT

4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SLPT IS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTAR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSIUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED MY OWN
4294-32859-0000 WHILE DUR WAS RATHER CERTAINLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISSLIKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDLE IN AND WRETCHES PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL SEE YOU THIS STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT DABBLED IN LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNATASISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND NORTHERN WHO WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD IN A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOT
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONEBEFITTING THEM MADE IN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL THE WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWIT THE GRINNING GESTURE BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SORT OF EFLOREIDE HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE GESTURE AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO HAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULD SPEND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL HAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS A THUNDER TIS THE OGA CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US WHEN YOGUES MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGUR STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND NASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS SPEED COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALL NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL THOUGHT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE TO STRIDE THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLAG TO MEET HIM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALK SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSRS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUP THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE AND CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN THAN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE DUE TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS THE BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL IN RAPT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH VAGATES THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL AND SOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHT AWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME NIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGOR
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WHERE EPLORED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT IF WILL READ HE DID NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LEFT THE PRINCE PRINCE IS OH
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT CRANE MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVED LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED OF FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HERSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED IN ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO THAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR ID AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT DETAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HUNT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD SUSTAIN HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENT BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCUR TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLE'D STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ALBOED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST HERFOR ACT TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID CURFEERRAC
4294-9934-0013 BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER BOLD HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COACH AND BY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 BUT THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMANY NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAINWORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS MEANT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRIENDS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCH MAKERS
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE WATCH TO FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HALLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PICKED ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAD TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOO VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAST SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD AND THE SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE VENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE WEEKS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND TO THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DESIRES A SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE ASCENDING AS KY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FEET SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WILL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT OF THE SKY
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED AND THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALATRICIAN NERVOUS SATURDAY AND SO LONG
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION SAYS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TO BIRTH THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN THE TRADITION
4350-10919-0009 YES SUCH AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THIS ALREADY PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE HOUSEKEEPERS DONE IT OR SHALL HAVE THE DRIVERON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED WHY IT IS
4350-10919-0012 BUT WELL THAN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT IT TO A RUN ASKED THE FELLOW DAUGHTER
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING ELECTRICIAN ENOUGH LOWERING
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DAUGHTER LISTENED ATTENDEDLY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVELL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING AT REMINISCENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ASKED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 FOUR TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING IF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM THEY PAID HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DECENTS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AGAIN
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME INTO SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED THEM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE WAS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASK ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE SOLITAR OF DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS ERADABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KATY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICLY EXPLAINED THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCES AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 BUT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED IN A DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FATE IN FOUR QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD AGAIN
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHAT SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KIDTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIPLE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL WAR
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE WAS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE ENTRANCE OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHOPINS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTION ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASE IS IF AT AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF BLIND BODILY VIOLENCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAIN TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IT IS THE BASIOUS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND OMEN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANY THING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER OF SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INSTEAD IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS TO THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SAYS THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SINCE THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF IN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENT OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTED
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRY BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND A LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROVE OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STAKE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS TRACIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL ASSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIAN INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERN AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTEST LINE BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN KNIGHTS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS HAS BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIME SUBDUED THEIR CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAS ALWAYS BUT
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA E USESIVE AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE HIS POSITION DEPOSITLY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE EPOCLASS KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE IN SUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG ON PINCCOTANTS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSIONS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPE'S ENGAGE SWIFTS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE REPUTS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF COULD PRIVY SPEECH PUT INTO PLAN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE IN SLAVE TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABOMINABL ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GIVEN THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS I SPLITTING THEIR SUCH AS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS AND SLAVE SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROJECT ITS BEAUTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONDIGIOUS AS MONASCUE POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NUMBERING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND AS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE THE UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS HAS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICEED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN IMPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORIOUS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERRENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MULTITUDERY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRENGTH SUBSTITUTEING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRENGTH WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRAISE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIGHT VEIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY A APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEED ABOVE ALL FOR EXCELLENT DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THAT ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SICK OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATES TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENARMA AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STAINED VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL SPOUSE PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SOLE
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TUNE WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE THE DISPENSE WITH STATEADE INFORMING SOCIETYS ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSS FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WILL BE INSLAYED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT IT TELLS WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATE WHO MIGHT HIS LABELS
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSAND PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMEDS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BIRDS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEIOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST GOOD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AN EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISPATCHES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH THE GREAT INCREASED DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 PRAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CHRIST LOOKED FROM WINDOW PLATED FLASH LIKE TO A CARD JACK CAN SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO ONE NEEDS A JOB BAN THAT'S JIKI HARRIS

4852-28311-0010 LIKE EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONE AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT COMPRESS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BCHER N GO IT AFTER ALL MISS TURNED TO WIN HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIGHT UNDERSTANDING ON THE CORNER
4852-28311-0013 ALMOST SHOCKS
4852-28311-0014 CRISTEL STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH COACHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WORKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE ALE SHAPED BRICK BUILDING IT SIR MISTER WORKERS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 NO LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK ON A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND HIS GUNS AN ABBEY HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF IN THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS IN A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THERE RISING BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GAY CLOUDS LOWER AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRISTENED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERY THING AND HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSES
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE IMMENSE THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER OF THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAYING GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROWES AND MANY A TIME GRIST SAFE AT HOME IN BED AND SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRA BELL
4852-28311-0024 HE'D NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WHITTAKER'S SHOP NOW HE'S THOUGHT OF THAT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SAIL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHORD WELCOMED FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES YOU EXAMINED MISTER WORKER'S WINDOW AND POURED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NEWIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GOT INTO MISTER HOOKER'S SHOP
