4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISSLAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THARTED

4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNATISED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND LORD HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG

4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING GESTURE BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MATLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SORT OF ELOREADE HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE GESTURE AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEARLY AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST WIND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMMLING AS A THUNDER TIS THE ELDER CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE THIS WHEN YOGOS MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASIM AND NASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS MINK COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL THOUGHT WHY I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE TO STRAYE THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY TO MEET HIM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYH HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING DAY UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THECISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE RECALLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE DUKE TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO COME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVESTED IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH VAGATES THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE ADE ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMEST WANDERER HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL AND SOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHT AWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLES SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGOUR
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHEL WED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT AT THE READER HE DID NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCES OH
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAHAM MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVED LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE BUT JUST ACQUIRED OF FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT BE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEARLY EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALFLIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FOREVER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD DISTRACT HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH APPEARED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF A CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON BOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST HER FACT TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID CURIFERRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD WHO IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WEST KIT A HAT AND A COAT AND BY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT WILL BE ENOUGH WITH
4294-9934-0017 OH IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WE DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU NOT CHAIRMAN NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY GAIN WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOSE DEALER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS TO THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCH MAKERS
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE WATCH CUR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HOLLOW I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPORT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TIN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A HUNG VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOU VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAST SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD AND A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH THE RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THANCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE TIMES LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALK TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DECIDE AS SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD DESCENDING AS KAY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCE TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPED SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT OF HIS SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASE IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALATRICIAN NERVOUS IN SADABILITY AND SO LONG
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION SAYS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TO BOOK THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN CONTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES SET'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THIS ALREADY PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE HOUSEKEEPERS DONE IT OR SHALL HAVE THE DRIVERERON
4350-10919-0011 SHE ASKED AH IT IS
4350-10919-0012 BUT WELL THEN I CAN DO IT AT TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT IT TO HER RUN ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED AS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING PATRICIAN ENOUGH A LOWERING
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTRINE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMISCENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE YET
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET HIM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN CORKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 BUT TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRINCESS A FEELING IF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM THEY PITIED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAINS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO GITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTRINE CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ADDED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 SEIZE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 IS IT THE THIRD TIME YOU HAVE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATIVE DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE A FACE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS HEREUTABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KATY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINED THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED IN A DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WATHY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FATE IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLI TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD NONE
4350-10919-0033 THEIR MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHAT SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KIDTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIPLED EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL WAR
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS OBSTINATELY INCORCT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE WAS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL PERCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACCENT ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASE IS AT AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF BLIND MODILY VIOLENCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTANTS OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL HE IS THE BASIS OF POWDER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALLMEN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER OF SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT COULD NOTP BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL CIVILIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASES ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MEN OF VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AND FORTY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENT OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTED
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE DAY SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND A LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATIONAL GROVE OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISCENSIONS AND SO THE STAKE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES OF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS TRAGIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DSENTIAN INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERN AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERN
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP THE FURTEST LINEON BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN KNIGHTS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA EUSIVE AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS IT DISPROVE HIS POSITION DEPOSITEDLY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE EPOCLASS KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INS SUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG ON PINCCOTANTS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE DRINK OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSIONS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWIFTS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE REPUTS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CONTRIVY SPEECH PUT INTO PLAN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE INSLAVE TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ENORMOUS ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERN THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS I SPLITTING THEIR SUCH AS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS AND SLAVE SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS FAVOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONDAGEOUS AS MODESTCHIE POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A FORCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSED THE UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAD BECOME THEIR OWN IMPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MELANCHOLY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFGANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORIOUS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSEURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIKE SUBSTITUTEING STRIP WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY ALSO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF THY SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FINAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENT IS CERTAIN THAT ARMIES ARE NEED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THERE NEEDED PRINCIPLELY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THAT ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM BY MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A ESTATES AND MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT WITH THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENGARMA AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STAYED VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL SPOUSE PERSONS EVEN IF A HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER KNOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO LONG
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM A SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUND THAT ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE THE DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETYS ASSOCIATIONS COPORATIONS AND CONGRESSS FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE INSLAYED BY THEIR NEIGHBOURS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT IT TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATE WHO MIGHT HIS LABELS
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSAND PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER OFFS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER AT SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH A STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST BUT NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSIVE
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING GLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOWS SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CHRIST LOOKED FROM MAGICAL PLATED FLASH LIKE TO A CARD JACK CAN SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO ONE NEEDS A JOB BAN THAT'S JIKI HERES
4852-28311-0003 O KAY HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHAT IN YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MICK BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AND MONASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FOOT OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EM STREET
4852-28311-0006 HOW HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CHRISTASED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THEY HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 THAT HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW A TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRISTENED INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 LIKE EXPRESSION CHANGED AT WHAT AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT EMBRAC WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BICCHER AND GO IT AFTER ALL MISS TURNED TO ON HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIGHT STANDING ON THE CORNER
4852-28311-0013 MOST SHAC'S
4852-28311-0014 CHRIST STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH COACHED ON THE HILL ABOUT MISTER WORKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE ILL SHAPED BRICK BUILDING IT SIR MISTER WICKERS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 NO LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK ON A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND HIS GUNS AND AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFTEN A SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS IN A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THEIR HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWER AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRISTIDED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AN EVERYTHING AN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSES
4852-28311-0021 THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER OF THE AUTUMN OF A SAILING SHIP AND A GREYING GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROWL AND MANY A TIME GRIST SAFE AT HOME IN BED AND SAILED THE IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRA BELL
4852-28311-0024 HE'D NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER HOOKER'S SHOP NOW HE'VE THOUGHT OF THAT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID YOU LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHORD AND WELCOMED FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES YOU EXAMINED MISTER WORKER'S WINDOW AND POUR IT OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NEWIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GOT IN TO MISTER BROOKER'S SHOP
