3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DREAMS AT ONE SHOUT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIUSAN
3997-180294-0018 WHENEVER REACHED HOME I WAS IN THE STATE OF MAD GAYETY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 SO WHY
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WHICH HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO KNIGHT AT A VADAVILLE
3997-180294-0023 CALM DURING THE THIRD AND TRAP
3997-180294-0024 THE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER A ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY HIS STAGE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CRIMSON FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARS
3997-180294-0027 THAT SHE LOVED ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKS THAT HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO KNIFE SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 HE SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC ARAB WHICH WENT SO LOW WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE

3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE BEING HIM

3997-180297-0001 YOU ARE THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID GOODNESS AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE

3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SEEING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT THIS SCIENCE NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND A LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT TO BE THE GREATEST HARM

3997-180297-0012 I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITHIN ADMIRATION

3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONCLUDED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRE AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PALITY OF BEING HOTTED DOWN AND OF ROODING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 WE NO LONGER BELONGED TO OUR OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WILL STAND FIRST AND THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR STEAM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DO HE GIVE THE ADVICE WHICH IS NOT NEGATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET ALL OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME WERE COME TO OUR BOX IN FUTURE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND THE OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES

4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEANTIME FRIDAY JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BUTTON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS THAT UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CALLED OF ASURE BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SORROW

4198-61336-0007 THE SHIFTY MAN TO ILLU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHALL DORIDGE WOULD RECOVER A STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADED NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGRAPH'S LEISURE HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN LAND WHERE HE WENT WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPADE WAS CAPTURED AND METAIL YOU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HEBREWS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH SYRIA
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN SYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MADELE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEO ASH THE GRANDSONO JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY CHALOMA

4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MANY HIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE SYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION

4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THIS DUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SAID AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES ABOUT WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME AIR

4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BYRNATONA WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND MONTONI LANDEY WITH HIM

4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACH MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WHILE DO WAS RATHER SURELY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS TWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY IS FRIEDLED IN AND WRETCHES PRETTY OUTLINES

4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THE YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SUN WAS LITTLE AND LOREN WHO WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE CALLED
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFORE BEFITTING THEM MADE IN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING GESTURE BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE SPELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF EFLOREIDE HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE GESTURE AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR THE HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST SEND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS THAT SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS A THUNDER TIS THE OVER CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US WHOM YOGOS MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGR STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND NASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS BEAK COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL FAULT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE TO STRAYE THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLIGHT TO MEET HIM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE LAW SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRIED TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE CISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPEN
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCESS'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE DO TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS IT BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY BRAIN MUST FALL IN ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH VAGATES THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE ADE ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR A LORD HOMELESS WANDERER HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL AND SOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHT AWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGOR
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE EPILORET'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT AT WILL READ HE DID NOT THERE TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVED THE PRINCE PRINCE IS OH
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED OF FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECTED ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT BUT HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO FAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYE'D AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT HANGED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FARTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD DISCHARGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCUR TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUSIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON HELPED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST HERFER ACT TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT AM YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLDEN HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A ESCORT A HAT AND A COAT AND BY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THATLL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU NOW GERMAN NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY CLEAN WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEARER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHM MAKERS
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT TO WATCH HER FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HULLO I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE PART
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCE LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SHOE VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD AND A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH THE RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE VENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE RANK LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THE THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DESIRED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE ATTENDING AS KAY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FIT SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THEIR HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LOOKS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCES WENT OUT OF THE SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALATRICIAN NERVOUS SATABILITY AND SO LONG
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION SAYS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TO BOOK THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN THE TRADITION
4350-10919-0009 YES SET AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THIS ALREADY PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE HOUSEKEEPERS DONE IT OR SHALL HAVE THE DRIVER ON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED ALL IT IS
4350-10919-0012 BUT WELL THEN I COULD DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT IT TO HER RUN ASKED THE FAIR DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED AS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING ELECTRICIAN ENOUGH LOWERING
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENDEDLY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVELL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING AT REMINISCENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE READ
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN CORPS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 THOSE TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING IF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM THAT PITIED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCIPAL COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO GAZE
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DAUGHTER CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL IT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE MY DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU ASK ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATIVE DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE A FENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS HERABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KATY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICLY SPLENDID THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEEKY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FATE IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY MEAN
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD YOUNG
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHAT SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KIDDY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIPLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL WAR
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORACT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS ARE THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROL BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASE IS IF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENT
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF BLIND BODY VIALANCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WOULD CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL THERE IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALMAN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER OF SECURE
4350-9170-0010 AND INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFYING
4350-9170-0012 BUT SAYS THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SENSE THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF IN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESSENED THE VIOLENT OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTED
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIP BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND A LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING CONTEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO IN HERAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STAKE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIESS OF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS TRACIFICATION IS EVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DESENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIAN INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNOR AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP THE FURTEST LINEON BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH GOLDEN KNIGHTS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS HAS BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASS OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA EUSIVE AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS IT DISPROVE HIS POSITION DEPOSITLY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE EPOCLASS KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE IN SUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG ON PINCOTANTS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE DRINK OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSIONS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGED SWIFTS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE REPUTS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF COULD PRIVY SPEECH PUT INTO PLAN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THESE SLAVES TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANK IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GIVEN THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS I SPORTING THEIR SUCH AS BY VIOLENT IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS AND SLAVE SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PRODUCT ITS BEAUTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONDAGEOUS AS MONASCUE POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SORT OF DANGER FOR NUMBERING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS WHO IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN IMPRESSS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORUOUS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MULTITUDE SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRENGTH SUBSTITUTEING STRIP WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRENGTH WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS AFFORD THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF THY SOCIAL LIGHT VEIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL MAGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEED ABOVE ALL FOR ETERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE ESTATES TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT WITH THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED OF THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSE PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENORMA AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STAINED VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL SPOUSE PERSONS EVEN IF A HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER KNOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SOON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM A SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DO ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TEA WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE THE DISPENSE WITH STATEADE FORMING SOCIETYS ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSS FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THAT TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATE WHO MIGHT HIS LABELS
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS AS MEANT ONE THOUSAND PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER WITH SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BIRDS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WHAT NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AN EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES ARE BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAVE YOU KNOW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CRIS LOOKED FROM INDICATED FLASH LIKE TO A CARD JACK AND SPARK PLUG

4852-28311-0010 LIKE EXPRESSION CHANGED AT WANT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT EMBRAC WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BICCHER N GO IT AFTER ALL MISS TURNED TO ON HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIGHT STANDING ON THE QUARTER
4852-28311-0013 MOST SHAKES
4852-28311-0014 CRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WORKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE ALE SHAPE BRICK BUILDING IT SIR MISTER WICKERS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 NO LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK ON A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND HIS GUNS AN ABBEY HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFTEN THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS IN A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THERE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GLAD CLOUDS LOWER AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CRISTOID TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERY THING AN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACH THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE MEANT THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER OF THE BOTTOM OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREYING GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROWL AND MANY A TIME GRIST SAFE AT HOME IN BED AND SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABEL
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER HOOKER'S SHOP NOW HE'S THOUGHT OF THAT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SAY
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHORN WELCOMED FROM THIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES YOU EXAMINED MISTER WORKER'S WINDOW AND POURED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NEWIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GOT INTO MISTER BROOKER'S SHOP
