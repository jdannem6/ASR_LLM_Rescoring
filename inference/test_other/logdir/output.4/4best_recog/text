4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SUN WAS LITTLE AND LAWN WHO WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD IN HIS DEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN

4294-35475-0004 FOURTHWITH THE GRINNING GESTURE BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SORT OF EPHLOREIDE HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE GESTURE AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAREST HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST RENT ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL PAIR WITH FILMY WINGS BUT SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE ELDER CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US WHEN YOKERS MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGERS STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND NASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS BEECH COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHERE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE TO DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLIES TO MEET HIM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT UPON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERS TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE IT CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN THAN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE DO TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT HAS BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND WRIT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH VAGATES THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE ADE ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR A LORD ALMOST WANDERER HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL AND SOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHT AWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME NIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHEL RED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHEL READ HE DID NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE SAYS OH
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVED LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE FIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAD LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRE THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT GAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HELP THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD EXCHANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUDMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SOUNDS OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ELEVATED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST HER FOR I TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFERAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER OLD HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WESKIT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT WILL BE ANOTHER
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WOULD YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU NO GERMAN NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PLAIN WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOSED DEALER WAS HUNT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHAKERS
4294-9934-0022 HE BROUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HULLO I'D FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE MADE ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCIS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUP VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FOR THE LAST SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD AND THE SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUSPICION MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRENCH LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND OF THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DESIRED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE ASCENDING HIS KAY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDED OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 HE IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU BELIEVE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT OF A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS ASSOCIATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALATRICIAN NERVOUS ANXIETY AND SO LONG
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION SAYS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TO BIRTH THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN AND TRADITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED HIS ALREADY PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE HOUSEKEEPERAGE DONE IT OR SHALL HAVE THE DRIVERON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED HA IT IS
4350-10919-0012 NO WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT IT TO A RUN ASKED THE FAIR DAUGHTER
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING TRADITION ENOUGH LOWERING
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED INTENTLY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE DID
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN CORKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 THOUGH TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED THE PRINCESS A FEELING IF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM THEY PITIED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCE COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO GETTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FRESHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ENTERED IN AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 PLEASE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS DID THE THIRD TIME YOU HAVE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE A FENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS HEREABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KATY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICLY EXPLAINED THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCES AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WATHY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FATE IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HEAVEN IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GUN
4350-10919-0033 THEIR MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHAT SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KATY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIPLE EVER GREWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL WAR
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORUPT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE ENTRANCE OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS A VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASE IS IF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENTS
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF BLIND MOLIEVALANCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT TACITS OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IT IS THE BASIS OF POWDER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALMEN AND POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER OF SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT WOULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS GOOD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SAYS THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASES ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENT OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTED
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATIONAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING CONGRESS
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STAKE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES OFF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS TRACIFIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INURAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIAN INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER AND PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP THE FURTEST WOMAN BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH GOLDEN KNIGHTS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS HAS BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED THY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO IT DOES ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA E USESIVE AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS IT DISPROVE HIS POSITION DEPOSITLY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE EPOCLASS KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FORTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE IN SUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG ON PINCCOTANTS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE DRINK OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSIONS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWIFTS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECUTS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CONTRIVY SPEECH PUT INTO PLAN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE A SLAVE TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERN THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS I SPREADING THEIR SUCH AS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS AND SLAVE SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOUR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONDAGEOUS AS MODESTCUE POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBOURING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE THE UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN IMPRESSRS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS A UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITOROUS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE WERE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRENGTH SUBSTITUTEING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF THY SOCIAL LIKE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL POSSESSION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ARE CERTAIN THAT ARMIES ARE NEED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THERE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THAT ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM MY MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATES TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT WITH A STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENLARMA AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STAINED VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL SPOSE PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER KNOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SOUL
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DO ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT HITHERTO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE THE DISPENSE WITH STATE AID FORMING SOCIETYS ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSS FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENT'S NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAYED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT IS TELL US WITH ITS ARMY HE IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATE WHO MIGHT HIS LABELS
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDS PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE TYPES OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEIOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WITH NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASING DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW SOME
4852-28311-0001 CHRIST LOOKED FROM INDICATED FLASH LIKE TO A CARD JACK AND SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO ONE NEEDS A JOB BAN LET'S JAKIE HEIRESS
4852-28311-0003 OLCAY HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHAT DID YOU ASK THEM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AND MOASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FOOT OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EM STREET
4852-28311-0006 ALL HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CHRISTASSED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THEY HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 THINK HE REALLY MADES IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW A TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CRISIT INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 LIKE EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONE AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT EMBRAC WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BECHER N GO IT AFTER ALL MISS TURNED TO ON HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIGHTWITHSTANDING ON THE CORRIDOR
4852-28311-0013 MOST SHACKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIST STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOUT MISTER WORKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE ILL SHAPED BRICK BUILDING IT SIR MISTER WORKERS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 NO LONGER WAYING TOWARD THE BACK ON A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND HIS GUNS AND AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF IN THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS IN A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THEIR HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GAY CLOUDS LOWER AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CRISTOCIDED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILLS HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AGAINST THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER OF THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREYING GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED THE PROW AND MANY A TIME GRIST SAFE AT HOME IN BED AND SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRA BELL
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER BROOKER'S SHOP NOW HE'S THOUGHT OF THAT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SEE
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHORE AND WELCOMED FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES YOU EXAMINED MISTER WORKER'S WINDOW AND POUR IT OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NEWIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GOT IN THE MISTER BROOKER'S SHOP
