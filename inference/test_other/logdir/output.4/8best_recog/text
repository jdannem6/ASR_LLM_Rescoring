3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DREAMS AT ONE ROUT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIUSAU
3997-180294-0018 WHENEVER REACHED HOME ALL WAS IN THE STATE OF MAD GAYETY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES OF MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 OH WHY
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXTINGUISHED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT A VADA VEIL
3997-180294-0023 CALM DURING THE THIRD AND TRAMPT
3997-180294-0024 THE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER THEIR ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY THEIR STAGE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST OCCASIONALLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 IF SHE LOVED ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKS BUT HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER OF YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 HE SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC ERA WHICH WENT SO LOW WITH HER DELICATE AND WHITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 WHERE AT ALL

3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT THIS BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SEEING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND A LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT SUIT ME THE GREATEST HARM

3997-180297-0012 I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WHEN ADMIRATION

3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONCLUDED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HALF FANTASTIC DESIRE AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER THE PALITY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF ROODING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 WE NOW LONGER BELONGED TO OURSELVES

4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS THAT UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE COLD OF ASHERE BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS RANGE THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING

4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THIS BREAST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SAID AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES ABOUT WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ARAB

4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BYRNATONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND MONTONI LANDEY WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO TROUTINA
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CANNOT PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR NEW GALSSANDRA WHICH IS STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE HONOR KING FRANCES OF FRANCES OF FRANCES OF FRANCES OF FRANCES THANKS TO TRY TO MAKE FOR YOU VERY CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME WITH THE EXCLUSION OF CORAL STATUTES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTAR'S CRAFT

4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOOM OF FINISHING MY PERSIUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN ART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WHILE DUR WAS RATHER SLOWLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISSLIKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDLAND AND WATCHES PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I LL TELL YOU THIS STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GUBBLED IN LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SUN WAS LITTLE AND NORTHERN WHO WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGH'D HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE WELL BEFITTING THEM MADE IN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL THE WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING GESTURE BEGAN SHRINKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF EPIREIDE HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE GESTURE AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO ASLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST WREN ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL PAIR WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS A THUNDER TIS THE OLDER CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US WHEN YOKERS MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGOR STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND NASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS BOOT COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMALST THOUGHT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE TO STRAYE THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLAG TO MEET HIM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT DONE THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT CRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE THAT CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS HEART FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE DO TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PRESENT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND RIGHT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH VAGATES THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE ADE ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL AND SOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHT AWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME NIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE ALGOUR
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE EPLORET'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT AT ALL READ HE DID NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE OH
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE JARM THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVED LATER
4294-9934-0001 HEED BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECTED ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT SHE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BATTLE LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRULY LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT MAINTAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HOLD THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD STRANGER HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS THAT OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SADS OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ARROWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST HER FORE ACT TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEERRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TOO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD HAIR IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROWUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT ILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 KNOW IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WE DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU NO CHAIRMAN NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY SEEN WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS HINT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCH MAKESRS
4294-9934-0022 HE BROUGHT THE WATCH HER FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 PILLOW I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPAR
4294-9934-0025 YOU HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED TOO VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FOR THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD AND SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH THE RESPECTFUL LETTER AND WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCIS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND A THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DESIGNS TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SENDING AS KAY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FRIEND SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 HE IS THEIR HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT TO THE SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF'S OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALATRICIAN NERVOUSING SATABILITY AND SO LONG
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION SAYS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TO BIRTH THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NEW TRADITION
4350-10919-0009 YES IT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED HIS ALREADY PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE HOUSEKEEPERGE DONE IT OR SHALL HAVE THE DRIVERON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED AH IT IT IS
4350-10919-0012 BUT WELL THEN I CAN DO IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT IT TO A RUN ASKED THE FAIR DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED AS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING PATRICIAN ENOUGH LOWERING
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DAUGHTER LISTENED INTENTLY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVELL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE MEANT
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN CORTHS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 LOW TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING IF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM THAT CREATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS FROM THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO COMMITTEE
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME ON SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED IT AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECTION IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS DID THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRRID OF DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS HERITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KING HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICLY EXPLAINED THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAIN HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WAKEY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FATE IN FOUR IN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR AT GUN
4350-10919-0033 THEIR MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHAT SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KIDDY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLED EVER GREWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL WAR
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INQUIRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED SINCE THE AIM OF LIGHT IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIANS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACCESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASE IS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY WILDS
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF BLIND BODILY VICE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT TACIT OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IT IS THE BASIS OF THE POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN AND POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER OF SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT SHOULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL OR ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SAYS THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN AND POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MEN OF VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AND FORTY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESSENED THE VIOLENT OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTED
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIKE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND A LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NARROW GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO IN HERAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STAKE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES OFF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS TRACATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 ANERAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIAN INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER A PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSION ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP THE FURTEST LINE BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH GOLDEN KNIGHTS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS HAS BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED THAT CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA EDUCEDIVE AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS IT DISPROVE HIS POSITION DEPOSITLY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE EPOCLASS KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FORTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE IN SUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG ON PINCCOTANTS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSIONS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGED TWISTS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECUTS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF COULDRIVY SPEECH PUT INTO PLAN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE INSLAVE TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THE ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERN THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS I SPORTING THEIR SUCH AS BY VIOLENT IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS AND SLAVE SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROJECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONDAGIOUS AS MONTEZU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE AND THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND HIS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE THE UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS WHO IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN IMPRESSES
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY IS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORIOUS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERANCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE THE GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MET TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRENGTH SUBSTITUTEDING STRIKE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE ORDERS OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIGHT VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY A APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS IS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THERE NEEDED PRINCIPLELY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT SHALL I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATES AND MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT WITH A STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSE PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIARMA AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STAYED VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL'S POST PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER KNOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO HOME
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM HIS SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUND IT ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE THE DISPENSE WITH STATEADE AND FORMING SOCIETYS ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSS FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENT'S NATIONS WOULD BE INLAYED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT AT TELL US WITH ITS ARMY HE IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATE WHO MIGHT HIS LABELS
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSAND PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT WITH THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS DISCLOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BIRDS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEIOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST ONE NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AN EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISCONTENTES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISCONTENTS WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 NAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CRIS LOOKED FROM UNDER CULTIVATED FLASH LIKE TO A CARD JACK CAN SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO ONE NEEDS A JOB BAN LET'S JAKI HEIRESS
4852-28311-0003 OLQUEY HE SAID

4852-28311-0008 THINK YOU REALLY MADES IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRISTIT INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 LIKE EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONE AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT MISS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BECHER N GO IT AFTER ALL MISS TURNED TO WIN HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIGHT WITHSTANDING ON THE QUARTER
4852-28311-0013 WASH SHOCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIST STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH COACHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WORKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE ALE SHAPED BRICK BUILDING IT SIR MISTER WICKERS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 NO LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK ON A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND HIS GUNS AND ABBEY HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF IN THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS IN A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAYED THERE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWER AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CRISICID TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERY THING IT HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FRONT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF RUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER OF THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP AND A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED THAT THE PROWL AND MANY A TIME GRIST SAFE AT HOME IN BED AND SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRA BELL
4852-28311-0024 HE'D NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER HOOKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF THAT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SOUTH
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHOORN WELCOMED FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES YOU EXAMINED MISTER WORKER'S WINDOW AND POUR IT OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NEWIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GOT IN THE MISTER HOOKER'S SHOP
