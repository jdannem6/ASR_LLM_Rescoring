3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE THAT MUCH SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESERTISHS
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WHAT A FOLLY OTHER WILL SOON BE BUILDED AND GIVE NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY CAUSE BY A GREAT ATTENTION UNCONSIDEABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIPS A FINGER INTO THE SERP AND APPLIED TO THE THUMB THE TENACI OF THE SERVE WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTEN BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCOB THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKING UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PROVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE WAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CAME
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN NINE
3538-142836-0009 BORE THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON THAT EFFORT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING CAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACCIDENT OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FIRST BY SIRP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOW OR UP AND ON A SEED AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH PATTERN CHILDREN BEING SEATED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY RETURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LINENSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARVELLIES JAMS AND FRUIT PACES OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARLIES AND JAMES DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PAP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RHINES WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPURING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAIN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIP UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONVICTIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBSRS AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOY WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMES WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATINWARD COMPOSE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFESSIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY COUSIN
3538-142836-0020 A THOUSAND AND MORE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD WE PURCHASE FROM THE CONVICTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE RAIN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGIES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL IN CIRCLE DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 ISIS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ASS ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE BATTLE IS GENUINELY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR PAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THESE TAKING OF THE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO EVOKE IN DISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE TILL THE TIME A WIDOW WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME CARED WORSE THAN WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GO SAID THE ADD
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM HIS SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FOR THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF WIND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE SWUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 BUT WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LONDON A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BE VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING SIDE ON SENDING STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH A COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNLAPPED
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THE NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BARED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TALK HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT OUT SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVENFOLDS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOLKS AND THAT HE COULD DO WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY IN WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HOW SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 I HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOOLS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE STIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME ENTER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME CALL YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE HOLES WERE MORE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLIFF OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HIS LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SUCH A LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LADD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH TO A PLACE SAID CINDER LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDER LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND LESS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAIN AIRS JUST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT HIS WHITE SAID CINDA LAD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKED LIKE THE CHINK OF A GREAT THICK BARCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SYLVIA HAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DROP FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO YIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS AND THE PRINCESS WHO NOW ARE TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE'S A MIGHTY SOUL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAVE A LONG LONG WAY THE FOLKS SAID GUST A SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE CORPORAL SEES THERE NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FORE DOESST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE HOLE AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SENOR LAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH HOOD ONE MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT UP AND THOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCH FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAVE AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE YIELD
3538-163624-0003 SO ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING INTO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVING ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOURS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER HE WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED ODOR WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH TO THE DOOR WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REAN MADE A SWORD AND CIGARETTE TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON ALL UP THE IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN CIGARETTE WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REACEN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGNATURE SAID THAT SORT WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED LONG AND LEFT TO DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT TRIGGER WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 CIGAR SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MEN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOUFFENER AND THEN STAFNNER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN CIGARETTE GREW BACK AND MET REEGAN AND RIGGING ASKED HIM TO ROAST AFTERER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO CIGARETTE PUT THE HEART OF FAT NOON A MISTAKE AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE CIGARETTE ROSTING FASTER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HIM FELT TO THE PLACE WHERE BURN HILLD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING WHO RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE BOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPERS AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN EDWARD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 WHEN BURNILLED FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUTTER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BURN HELD IN GUNDRA AND WERE BATHING BURN HAD WAITED FARTHER SOUTH INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDERANT SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HADRIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WLT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS AND LOBSTER
367-130732-0001 WHEN AS THE LUBS DO NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMEER OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO CAN THIS EVIDENCES OF AN EAST FOR WHAT HAS CALLED A LOBSTER AND FRANCISCO IS NOT A ABSURD ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH ARE ASSERTS EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT TO DELICATE FLAGR AS OUT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIA WAS STRENULOUSLY INSISTS AND IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIA
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY SHEFTS OF WARD BY FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER AND LADY NEWBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE REST BE THOUGH A FOLLOW WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DORMONICO

367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAFT AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBYS OF BEFORE THE FAR BUT HIS PROCEEDS DID NOT DESCEND TO HER

3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TONS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL EYE LEADING TO THE NUN'S CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TENDING A FRIENDS WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER REINS CONQUERED THE WINGS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRETINUM FROM WHOM
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD RECESSES HE HAD LOSSES UNCHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF ORTHE BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER

3764-168671-0052 A FAUCHEUVAL WHICH UP HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERERIOUS SMILE
3764-168671-0054 ONE MUST EACH
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING HE WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE

3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNS UP THE HEART THISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOST BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCTS
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HIS SELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHY PROOF TO GIVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELDS WAS ONE DEEP DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
