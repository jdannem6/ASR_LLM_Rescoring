3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE THAT MIGHT SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR ACCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 THREE GATHERED IN WHAT A FOLLY OTHER WILL SOON BE BUILDED AND GIVE NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY CARS BY A GREAT ATTENTION UNCONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIPPED THE FINGER INTO THE SERP AND APPLIED TO THE THUMB THE TENACI OF THE SERVE WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTEN BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCOM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP AND A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PURSE OF MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE IS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CAME
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN O NINE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE THEY SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE THAT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON THAT EFFORT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING CAN INTO AN EARTH AND PAN IS THAT THE ACCENT OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FORCE BY SIRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOW OR UP AND ON A SEED AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDER CHILDREN BEING SHIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEIR TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND WOMANSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARBLEADES GEMS AND FRUIT PACES OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARLIES AND JAMES DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LANGUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE POP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RHINES WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SHIVER FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAIN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ALL THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBUTE UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFESSIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFESSIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBSRS AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOY WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMES WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATINWARD COMPOSE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM COMPLEXIONARY EMBRACES A DAY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY COUSINE
3538-142836-0020 A THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASE FROM THE CONVICTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE RAIN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 ICEES
3538-142836-0024 AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES EYES AS ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE BATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BROAD AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR PAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THESE TAKING OF THE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE IN DISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONE TILL THE TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PIECE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY HER HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GO SAID BAG
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND THOUGHT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE TASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OFLAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEAT
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAINST
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LUN HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTYLY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SENDING STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH A COLD SNAKE UNPAIDED AND UNLAPPED
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THAN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN THEY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHT THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVENFULS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH SAW THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOLKS AND THAT HE COULD DO WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT A HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 AND THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PUBLISHED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THEFULS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE MISCHIEF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HERE COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME CALL YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LIKE THE HOLES WERE OVER THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLIFF OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY CEDAR LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERWAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH TO A PLACE SAID CINDA LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUST RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINNER LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEY ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAIN EARTH DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID CINDELAD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKS LIKE THE CHUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SYLVIA HAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DROP FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO FEEL THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHO NOW ARE TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE'S A MIGHTY TROUBLE WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAVE IT A LONG LONG WAY THE FALL SAID JUST A SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE CORPORAL SEES THEM NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOOL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOOL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SIGNORAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTHWARD ONE MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FELT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE YIELDED
3538-163624-0003 SO ASK THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DROVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOURS BRAVE WAS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED AUDTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REKIN MADE A SWORD AND CIGARETTE TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON ALL UP THE IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN CIGARETTE WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND AS FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REAKEN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGNATURE SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO THE CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT CIGAR WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGNIFICANT SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MEN LET DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOUFFENER AND THEN STAFNER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN CIGARETTE GREW BACK AND MET REGAN AND RIGGING ASKED HIM TO ROAST AFTERER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO CIGARETTE PUT THE HEART OF FAT NO ON A MISTAKE AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE'S CIGARETTE ROSTING FASTER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HIM FELT TO THE PLACE WHERE BURN HILL'S SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING WHO RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VALLEY FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEP WHERE AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN TRIGGER RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 WHEN BURN HILL FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THEN THEY RODE AND GUTTER SHUT HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BROWN HELD IN GUNTER AND WERE BATHING BURN HAD WAITED FARTHER OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDERANT SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARE FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BETTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERERS
367-130732-0001 WHEN AS THE LOTS DO NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMEER OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO CAN THIS INSTANCES OF FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT HAS CALLED A LOBSTER AND FRANCISCO IS NOT A ABSURD ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH ARE ANSWERS EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT TO DELICATE FLAOR AS OUT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIA WAS STRENULOUSLY INSISTS AND IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIA
367-130732-0004 A BOOK WOULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THAT ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY SHEFTS OF WARD BY FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER AND LYNDE NEWBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE REST BE THOUGH A FOLLOW WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DORMONICO

367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBYS OF BEFORE THE FAR BUT HIS PROCEEDS DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
