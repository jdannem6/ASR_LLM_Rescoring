3528-168669-0125 IN WILL BE GIVEN TO THE EARTH EMPTY
3528-168669-0126 AH THEDA EXCLAIMED THE FRESH LITTLE
3528-168669-0127 THE VEIL STUCK FASTENED HIS SWORD
3528-168669-0128 HE MADE HASTE TO ADVISE AND EXPEDIENT TO MAKE HER FORGET THE OATH

3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE THAT MANY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESERTICHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 WHO GATHERED IN WHAT A FOLLY OTHER WILL SOON BE BUILDED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY CARS BY A GREAT ATTENTION ANDCONSIDEABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIPPED THE FINGER INTO THE SERP AND APPLIED TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SERVE WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTEN BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SUMB THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE BOIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE WAS NOW GIVEN AWAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CAME
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN FORTY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BORE THEM UP THREE DAY SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON THAT EFFORT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING CAN INTO AN EARTH AND PAN IS THAT THE ASPECT OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FIRST BY SURUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOW OR UP AND ON A SEED AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POTED CHILDREN BEING SHIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEIR TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LIVINGSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARBLE AIDS GEMS AND FRUIT PACES OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARLIES AND JAMES DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE POP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RHYMES WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE DESPAIRING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAIN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBUTE UNLESS THE JAMIES MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFESSIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBSRS AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOY WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMES WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATINWARD COMPOSE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM COMPLEXIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CLEANE
3538-142836-0020 A THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT HAD DRAWN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD WE PURCHASE FROM THE CONVICTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE RAIN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERVES
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIS AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 IS ICES
3538-142836-0024 AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ALICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE SPECK IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR PAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THESE TAKING ANY SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO EVOKE IN DISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE TILL THE TIME THE WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY IT HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FEARED WORSE AND MORE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GIRL SAID THE ADD
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURES SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH TO THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST I CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AS SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASK HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO HUNT HER BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BENT VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BURST HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SENDING STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH A COLD SNAKE UNPODIED AND UNLAPPED
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THERE NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEY NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GETT A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FULS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH SAW THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORD TO WASH THE FOOLS AND THAT HE COULD DO WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU MARCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT A HOW SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 I HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEE A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 WHEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD POLISHED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FALLS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE MISCHIEF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME ANOTHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME CALL YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE HOLES ROOM WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLIFF OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HOG
3538-163622-0009 SO THAT HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SO DE LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE CHIEF BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SIR TO A PLACE SAID CINDERLAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUST RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDER MAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYING ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAIN HOUSE JUST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID CINDALOD
3538-163622-0017 AND LOOKED LIKE THE CHUNK OF A GREAT THICK BARCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SILVER LAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DROP FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WHEEL THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM NOW ARE TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE'S A MIGHTY TROUBLE WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAVE IT A LONG LONG WAY THE FALL SAID GUST I SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE CORPORAL SEES THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOOL DOES I NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS THE RIVER SAID THE FOOL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINNER LAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTHWOOD WHEN MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT ON AND THOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAVE AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE WHEELED
3538-163624-0003 SO I ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS CROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTTER AND IF YOURS BRAVE IS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED AUDER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DOOR WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FOR HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO WIGAN MADE A SWORD AND SUGAR TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON ALL UP A IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN CIGARETTE WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REACIN
3538-163624-0010 SO SILVER SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO THE CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED LONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT CIGARETTE WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIDE INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SILVER SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETT DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FLAFFER AND THEN STAFFER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN CIGARETTE GREW BACK AND MET REEGAN AND BRIGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST AFTERER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO CIGARETTE PUT THE HEART OF FAT NOR AN A MISTAKE AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE SUGAR ROSTING FASTENER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HIM FELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BURN HILL'S SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING WHO RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE BELL FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AT BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SUGAR RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 WHEN BURI HILL FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUTTER SHUT HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BROWN HELD IN GUNDRON WERE BATHING BURN HAD WAITED FARTHER OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDERANT SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDTEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SORT STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
