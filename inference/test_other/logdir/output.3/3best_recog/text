3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE THAT MY SOCIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESERTISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FOOD GATHERED IN WHAT A FOLLY OTHER WILL SOON BE BUILDED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY CARS BY A GREAT ATTENTION UNCONSIDEABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIPS A FINGER INTO THE SERVE AND APPLIED TO THE THUMB THE TENACI OF THE SERVE WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTEN BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SKUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SPOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE IS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CAME
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN THIRTY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BORE THEM UP THREE THEY SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE RECENT EFFORT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING CAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACCIDENT OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FIRST BY SERVE WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOW OR UP AND ON A SEED AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH PATTERN CHILDREN BEING SHIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEIR TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORIGIN AND WOMENSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARVELADES JAMS AND FRUIT PACES OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARLIES AND JAMES DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RHINES WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPAREING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERV MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAIN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBUTE UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN OR EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONVICTIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBSRS AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOY WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMES WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATINWARD COMPOSE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFESSIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY COUSINE
3538-142836-0020 A THOUSAND AND MORE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD WE PURCHASE FROM THE INSPECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGEES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCLE DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 ICE
3538-142836-0024 AT DESARTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE BATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIDE AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR PAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THESE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO REVOKE IN DISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE TILL THAT TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PIECE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO HER HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE THAN WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GO SAID BAB
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THESE PROMISE TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THERE CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY MOTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAY ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LET HER BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BENT VERY PRETTYLY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SENDING STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH A COLD SNAKE UNPITED AND UNLAPPED
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOGOUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND YET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOOLS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WERE TO WASH THE FOLKS AND THAT HE COULD DO WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME IN TO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HOUSE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 THEY HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 WHEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOLDS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE MISCHIEF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME THERE COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME CALL YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE HOLES ROOM WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLIFF OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THEN HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SO THE LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SIR TO A PLACE SAID CINDA LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUST RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDA LAD
3538-163622-0014 ANDLESS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAIN HOURS JUST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT HIS WHITE SAID CINDELAD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKS LIKE THE CHUNK OF A GREAT THICK BARCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SILVER LAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DROP FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS AND THE PRINCESS WHOM NOW ARE TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE'S A MIGHTY TROUBLE WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAVE IT A LONG LONG WAY THE FOLKS SAID GUST A SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE CORPORAL SEES DONE NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FORE DOES THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FULL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SAINT LAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTHHOOD ON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND THOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKEN AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCH FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE YIELD
3538-163624-0003 SO ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING THEN SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DIV ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTAR AND IF YOURS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED ODTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DOOR WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM WHOM
3538-163624-0008 SO WIGAN MADE A SWORD AND CIGARETTE TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON UP THE IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN CIGARETTE WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO RECON
3538-163624-0010 SO SEVERE SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT CITOYEN WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGNATURE SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LET'S DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOUFFER AND THEN SAFNNER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN CIGARETTE GREW BACK AND MET REGION AND WIGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST AFTERER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO CIGARETTE PUT THE HEART OF FAT NOR ON A STAKE AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THEIR CIGARETTE ROSTING FASTENER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HIM FELT TO THE PLACE WHERE BRUNHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING WHO RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VEIL FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEP AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGNATURE RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 WHEN BURNILLED FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUTTER SHUT HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BURN HELD IN GUNDRON WERE BATHING BURN HAD WAITED FARTHER OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDERANT SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD WRITTEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WI NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD

3764-168671-0016 JO VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS

3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TENDING OF FRIENDS WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER REINS CROOKED THE WINGS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRETINIME FROM WHOM

3997-180294-0011 THEY LOVED BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTANCE
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WOULD IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HIS SELF PEOPLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
