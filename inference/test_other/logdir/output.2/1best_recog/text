3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY ESCAPE IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN HONEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANYONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT I IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HUTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE IT ALL FOR SO SAYS OF JUSTINIAN'S VAPOURSHING THE NEIGHBORS ANDAYED IT THAN THAT BY THE NEIGHBORS THE NEIGHBORS AND HAPPY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE WITH THEM WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBORS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN IT ON ANY OCCASION WHAT SO ETHEL YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE HE KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU HE SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM SUDDEN HE KNOWS YET MOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE CALL ME
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARN IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN TEACHES
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN HONEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LET A PLEASE ME
3080-5040-0000 WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVISER IS CARRIED TO A TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY THOMAS
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHAT TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE IN BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET AN HONEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PAINT IN WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LATTICE ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET HIGH A VALUE UPON HER SISTER AND SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER GONE AND YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TO HEED

3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVE ME
3080-5040-0017 BUT I AM CALLED UPON
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTED FOR YOUR MONSTER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FOR A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MOREN ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS AND THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNEDING IT

3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YOU WILL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AND EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGHED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSON
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SEE OUR PRAISE AND WE HAD TIME
3080-5040-0027 WELL IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURE
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS A FINEST BOY THAT ERE YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT ALL HIS FATHER AT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU US WITH DISCOURSES OF A FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU HAD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOT FOR ANY OTHER KITCHEN OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MY THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OFF HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NOR OLD WOMAN WHO PAUSES FOR WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASANT TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS WITH THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASCOT WITH NINE PEAS INCH UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PUT HER HEAD DOWN TURNED HIS GOOD BACK PUT HER FEET IN THE FENDER AND TOOK POT ON INTO HER LAP ORDER FIT ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SECOND
3331-159605-0001 THE MOP PROPOSAL WAS THE MORE CREDIT
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE OFF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE THUS ASK ME AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I AM
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET MISS C HOW CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS PARTLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAYED HIM MORE THAN ONCE THE WEAK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE BLESSED LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVE OF ROMANCE INTO HER LONG HOT WALKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHED MEN'S A POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDISQUIVABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL AND MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED A WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD BEEN A SPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIGHT OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS PARTY AND IT FOLLOWED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAUNTS A SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE A BEACH INTO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0014 PARTY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SITNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICA OF THE LOVE PICTURES THE ONLY KIND IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE SURELY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLICE IN DISPOSITION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN AG EYES PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPIES OF THE OLD EVEN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SET ITAKE CAME POLLY STUDD AT HIS FUTURE FOR A VISIT TO BACK HE AND FAST BUT COULDN'T RESIST STEPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE POSSIBLE FAN THAT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOCK BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TEN A HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASTER CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMMY AND TALK PRETTY LIKE WILLIAM FLASSY SAID THE MAID
3331-159605-0019 AT THE STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC WARY WAS RELUCTANTLY SURROUNDING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO PONY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER TILL SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MEANT
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO BLESSED TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS TO WAKE IT TO THE HORSE ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRIGHTENEDNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE CHOICED TO MEN TO FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU NO
3331-159605-0026 LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRIP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HAND THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS WAS OFF TO SETTLE THE MEADOW AT ONCE FOR PARTY'S SAKE AS WALLACE'S OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO AND YOU MADE A LAST POINT IN REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING YOUR FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN AND BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME AND NIGHT
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUET IN HER AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHT FORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WIDE LIKE LOVELY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND EXCEPT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAITH WITH WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FOR MANY THAT UNCLE HAD WHO LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 LOOKING TO AND FOREST USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS YOU'LL CHILLED HIM
3331-159605-0035 UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MANY SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PITCHON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE POTLES AND NONE FUSS ABOVE RUBBERS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED PARTY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIE FAN
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRAYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND A HALF
3331-159605-0042 LET JUST GAVE HIM A HIND AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THAT THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN A MIND WOULD CITY TEDLESS SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANDLEMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M ART YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST DIVIDE IN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERYONE WAS SOBUSY OF THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANS OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WHEN NOT BUTTERED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE ALLEN DID ITS ROCK AND WEND ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THAT THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THE ICE WITH THEM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SIDNEY OFTEN CALLED TERRIFICATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH PARTLY REGARDED LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM RODE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THEY LET US WAS SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NOW I'M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRAVEL BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT A DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED POLLY IF THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 POOR PARTY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT ALLOWED TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE BEEN NEEDED HOTEL HER FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE A HEAD IN THE SILVER CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH AND THE HUNDREDS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT A GUESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TEN EARNEST AND DEFINED THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVE AND ADMIRATION OF PARLEY'S LIARTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ODD ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEWER RELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVES A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE FELLOWS WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MAN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOLD MARIA BAILEY'S ONLY THING SIR SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HOPE FOR ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO PAIR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINDOW FROM THE LAST ABOVE THE GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BY THAN SHE SUSPECTED IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SITNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THE CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME IN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTED A SICK DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SOON ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT BRENDA AND THOSE NEWS TO HER SAW AND VONDA UTTERED MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN AT A DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME WALKING IN THE POND HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE POOR TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HAD HE KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY READ
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAGON THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSIEUR SAINT FOURSCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSIEUR SAGERIAN MONSIEUR SAINT TRULY GAVE IT TO MONSIEUR SAINT YOUUSSIBIUS A SIGNOR SAINT YOU SEE THIS GAVE IT TO MONSIEUR SAINT PERCOPIUS ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOL GIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THE VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FANTRIVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THE SUBJECT SO ANY ONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE ON OCCUPIED OR BORE IN THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHOCOLATE SYMPATHETIC RELIC
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS THAN OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EVER TO FLY BUT THE DANCERS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE COLLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIRUS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
