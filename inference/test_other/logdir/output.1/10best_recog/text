1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED LOUDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO GAIN HIS OWN MORTAL PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HOPE THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TIDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT

1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MAN AROUND HIM THOUGH A POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS AFTER THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS EYE IN NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT BACIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVEMENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MAGUA WAS COLLECTING HIM MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE YOUR FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE

1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBERS SOON AFTER DIXON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STALL OUT SHE COULD A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAY FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENJOY SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FROM WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADEN HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
