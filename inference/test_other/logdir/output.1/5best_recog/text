1688-142285-0001 MY GOOD SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHORT BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU SOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKE THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF RICHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS A THING A LIKE BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISS THE HARLE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PART OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HE FOLLOWED DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WALKHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BID THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHUNK FROM THE DISCLOSES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO GAIN HIS OWN MOTOR PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST MY FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TIDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEAVE MILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED COST A FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OPAUGH BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WOLF
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL PALACE HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THOUGH A POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS AS OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VENCIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROFITANT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGUERITE WAS COLLECTING HIM OTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE THE FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER ACT IT CAME
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PUSS ME I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL

1688-142285-0030 SHE DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN A BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS A CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF A MISTRESS COLD UP ON THE SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBERS SOON AFTER DIXON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE COULD A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAY FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENJOY SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FORMER WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH REFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADEN HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE WITH THE MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANTS GAVE DIXON PERMANENT CITIZENS SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIMES OF THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MAN OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS

1688-142285-0051 THE CHAP US IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AND SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SCALED STREET BUT HE SAID
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER IS AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GOFISH AT FIRST
