5694-64029-0004 THE INCUP PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
5694-64029-0005 I AM A VISITOR YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SUCCESSION ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF A RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE'S STEP WOULD GET IT
5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED MY GUN
5694-64029-0010 HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISTED ITS AIM
5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MONEY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
5694-64029-0014 BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
5694-64029-0015 THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
5694-64029-0016 I CALL LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEE OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME AND OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK
5694-64029-0017 THE YENKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDER FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WICKERSON TURN PIPE
5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SEES FIRE AND YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
5694-64029-0021 OAKLY COLORED BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE AKY LINE WITH HIS COLLARS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HAIL STORMS SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND REFORMED
5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEED HIM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT DID HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
5694-64029-0025 I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FOR MY SHOULDER
5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONE
5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR GROAN
5694-64029-0029 BUT IT COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED OUT FOOT QUICK
5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED THE NIGHT ATTACK
5694-64038-0000 ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE
5694-64038-0001 YAK SAYS WHAT DO YOU DO IN JOHNNIE
5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED AROUND AT LANA CROSSED THE CHANOVOCHI AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSON
5694-64038-0003 INSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YENK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAY BE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HULLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOS
5694-64038-0006 A YAK HE ALLA SAYS NAGGER
5694-64038-0007 THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY
5694-64038-0008 A MAN IN THE WILL
5694-64038-0009 THE VOICE APPEAR TO BE OVERHEAD
5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON SETTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSALLED PROBLEM
5694-64038-0012 THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WAY ALL NIGHT
5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL ROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
5694-64038-0014 I DON'T THINK ITS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
5694-64038-0015 WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENACY SIDE OF TENNESSE RIVER
5694-64038-0016 WE HAD BEE FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
5694-64038-0018 WE WERE INURRED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE AND EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE AND EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY AND EVERY DEFEAT
5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER A WHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN I GANG THE LAW
5694-64038-0021 YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW
5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM IT TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURPHY SQUIRREL PIKE
5694-64038-0024 A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIMM'S REGIMENT
5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED A SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
5895-34615-0000 BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNANIME OF JOY
5895-34615-0001 SUCH IMPERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE
5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SOWORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT
5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MONIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION
5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS IN MOUNTEBANK
5895-34615-0006 HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORMS
5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LIFE WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
5895-34615-0008 THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INFERIOR
5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICTUS
5895-34615-0010 ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGRAVATED IT
5895-34615-0011 AND EVERLASTING LAUGH
5895-34615-0012 THE MANICHEIANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
5895-34615-0013 THE HALL OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT
5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LIFE WAS EVERLASTING
5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PLAYED THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENCE TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANNACEASIA
5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GEMIST AND AN ATHLETE
5895-34615-0018 GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW AIR
5895-34615-0019 HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MAN THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD AND STORIES
5895-34622-0001 IN GWYNPLAINE'S EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENNED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
5895-34622-0002 WHICH WAS THIS NOTHING
5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
5895-34622-0004 THE MEALS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TWO PANTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGEERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOTH INTO A THEATRE
5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASS HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT
5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISED
5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSSFORD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FATES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE SUGGESTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSIS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATION OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SO SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE RED PHOEBE AND VENUS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
5895-34622-0015 PHOEBE COOKED VENUS RUBBED THE TEMPLE
5895-34622-0016 URSUS AND HOMA TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BED CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0019 ALOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
5895-34622-0020 URSTUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
5895-34622-0021 THEN I LOOKED PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE IGENERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
5895-34622-0023 URSUS WASN'T EVERYTHING IN THE PEACE AND THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTH WORK
5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHTED TO URSUS
5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL IS A SAME ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR
5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDER FOR THE GREEN BOX
5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATRE READY MATE
5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THE WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINED THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES PHEEBE AND SOMETIMES FAMOUS
5895-34629-0009 WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSTUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
5895-34629-0010 THEY BEGAN THE PERFORMANCES
5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTOBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTHWORK RUNNING CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MEN
5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS IN MOUNTEBANKS OF TOTTINGZO FIELD WERE A GASTIC GWYNPLAINE
5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THERE PUBLIC
5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWARDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKEERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS COMMITTEE OF JAWS AND CAUSE WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGUOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKSPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PAST LONDON BRIDGE
5895-34629-0020 THESE WERE REMARKABLE TELLINGS
5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTH WORK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC GUARDIANS
5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTIING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOZER WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MEN
5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC A PAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTER PIECE OF URSUS
5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERV HIM
5895-34629-0029 THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISIT
5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NAUTILUS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
5895-34629-0031 WHAT A PITI THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMEOUS SCOUNDREL
5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
6241-61943-0000 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIPALKERY
6241-61943-0001 BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SIGNS MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER
6241-61943-0002 WELL AND HAVE WE A FAREWELL WIND
6241-61943-0003 MY ELK WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET
6241-61943-0004 BUT NO GHOST DO ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
6241-61943-0005 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK
6241-61943-0006 NO MISTER HARD WIGG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
6241-61943-0007 AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOMEDAY
6241-61943-0008 ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNTAINAGEL'S YOKELE WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
6241-61943-0009 THE VOLGERY KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD
6241-61943-0010 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WHALES AND SHARKS
6241-61943-0011 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE HIS LAND
6241-61943-0012 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PATRIOTICAL VESSEL
6241-61943-0013 THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THIS SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
6241-61943-0014 HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BEARAN TRAMP
6241-61943-0015 THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD A DEAL WITH
6241-61943-0016 THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC IN LATIN
6241-61943-0017 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO STAND ONE ANOTHER
6241-61943-0018 NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS ANNE GOES WELL THE WORST DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
6241-61943-0019 IN THE MEAN TIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
6241-61943-0020 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SOCK NUISOME
6241-61943-0021 I SHALL BE GLAD TO INSULT THEM
6241-61943-0022 THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSOLUTE ON DUTY
6241-61943-0023 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKE TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES
6241-61943-0024 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION
6241-61943-0025 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS IN THE ROOF WHICH GRASSES CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
6241-61943-0026 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH TRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
6241-61943-0027 THE MEN APPEARED ROBEUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MEAN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LATTER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESKIMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POOR CIRCLE
6241-61946-0000 I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELLING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
6241-61946-0001 HAN'S OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP
6241-61946-0002 ARE TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR
6241-61946-0003 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FORE PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTH WEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VANACULAR IS CALLED SUEDVEST FEUDINGER
6241-61946-0004 WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARS MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
6241-61946-0005 THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEEDED IN A GOOD SHOE OF YELLOW
6241-61946-0006 I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED SCENTAR
6241-61946-0007 SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
6241-61946-0008 WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT ARE WORTHY GUIDE
6241-61946-0009 I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SIZE
6241-61946-0010 MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS WERE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
6241-61946-0011 HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN IN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BUR OR ICELAND A HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS IN THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
6241-61946-0012 A FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
6241-61946-0013 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNUFFELS WHERE A GLUMRATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
6241-61946-0014 THEY CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
6241-61946-0015 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARTER WAS TO BE FOUND
6241-61946-0016 THE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
6241-61946-0017 TO RIDE OR SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
6241-61946-0018 IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN YOURS
6241-61946-0019 BUT MY UNCLE WASN'T NO HUMOR TO WAIT
6241-61946-0020 AT LENGTH THE STARTY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SUPPER STONE LIKE THE COLOSSES OF ROADS
6241-61946-0021 HE SAYS TIED REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE SPANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
6241-61946-0022 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FORD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
6241-61946-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FAIRY BOATS OF THE ELB I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOOKCOMOTION
6241-66616-0000 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENYED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
6241-66616-0001 ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WILL BIG A ONE'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
6241-66616-0002 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN AWAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
6241-66616-0003 A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WONDER AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
6241-66616-0004 THREE DAYS LATER MINIATALKI BECAME NOSON'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
6241-66616-0005 FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEWED WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNDER THE SECOND GENERATION
6241-66616-0006 MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEW SOME AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
6241-66616-0007 THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND KNEW SOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MEN AT TALKING
6241-66616-0008 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABBY RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETOCKEY AS SHE BECAME ORDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
6241-66616-0009 WHILE BEYOND THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWOREY SINEWY AND AGILE AS A LINKS AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
6241-66616-0010 ONE OF NEW SOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MEN ATTACKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
6241-66616-0011 CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PAST IN POOR ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
6241-66616-0012 THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRAVE PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WALKING WAS SIXTEEN AND MANY A TALKEY TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
6241-66616-0013 IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOUNDS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
6241-66616-0014 AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRESS UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
6241-66616-0015 BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINIATARKI AND HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0016 NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
6241-66616-0017 A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURERS PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
6241-66616-0018 BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WHILE HE WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNETALKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0019 THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
6241-66616-0020 SPRING CAME IN PASSED AND THEN SUMMER
6241-66616-0021 WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN INTO TROT IN THREE YEARS
6241-66616-0022 WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN
6241-66616-0023 THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WHAT THEY GO ON'S REPLY
6241-66616-0024 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET RID AT SPRUCE WOOD ON THE BLACK STERN RIVER
6241-66616-0025 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF ROBY'S LETTER FOUND RAWDON HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
6295-244435-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE WHOLE COMING
6295-244435-0001 COLONELLY AND I'S TALBOT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
6295-244435-0002 BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY
6295-244435-0003 BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FOUR END THE SHORE
6295-244435-0004 THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER THE HARBOR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS AT SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
6295-244435-0005 THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SOMETER IS OURS
6295-244435-0006 BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED
6295-244435-0007 ALL THE IMINITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
6295-244435-0008 THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSE AND ARKENSA FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KUTUKI AND MEZURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
6295-244435-0009 LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HENRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURE
6295-244435-0010 THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENTAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY
6295-244435-0011 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF BLOOM
6295-244435-0012 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOUR THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
6295-244435-0013 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTIONS SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT
6295-244435-0014 BORGYARD AT ONCE WROTE IN ORDER
6295-244435-0015 COLONEL KINTON WRITES WISELY
6295-244435-0016 WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
6295-244435-0017 HENRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DEL LINNA'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE
6295-244435-0018 HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SAW HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE
6295-244435-0019 HENRY GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
6295-244435-0020 WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPE THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
6295-244435-0021 IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LAID IN APRIL
6295-244435-0022 FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE
6295-244435-0023 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF HIM
6295-244435-0024 HE GAZEED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS
6295-244435-0025 BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THAT VAULT ON THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
6295-244435-0026 IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND FAIRLAGE
6295-244435-0027 HE WAS GONE HOME AFTER VICTORY
6295-244435-0028 HE SOON LEFT CHARLES THAN OUT OF SIGHT
6295-244435-0029 HE FELT THE DIFFERENT AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE
6295-244435-0030 PEOPLE WERE CRUELER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
6295-244435-0031 THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SELF CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANG TO IT
6295-244435-0032 IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CRESTS
6295-244435-0033 IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTER AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY
6295-244435-0034 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES AN OLD KENTUCKY
6295-244435-0035 BILL SKILL AND HIS GANG THEM MOUNTAINEERS WERE UP
6295-244435-0036 HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERY MAN WHOM HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
6295-244435-0037 IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID CARLINGS
6295-244435-0038 HARRY THANKED HIM THROUGH HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIBERTYMEN RODE AWAY
6295-244435-0039 THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TOO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
6295-244435-0040 BUT HE SAW NOTHING THE MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
6295-64301-0000 ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR NEST BRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
6295-64301-0001 IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY WHEN SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY
6295-64301-0002 WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOT PATH
6295-64301-0003 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
6295-64301-0004 EARTH WAS DAWN AND HEAVEN WAS ALL
6295-64301-0005 BLESSED AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESS SHALL I BE THERE THEN
6295-64301-0006 WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLOURS
6295-64301-0007 JUST THEN HE WAS A NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS
6295-64301-0008 THE NETTLE ON THE DARK SAID JOSEPH
6295-64301-0009 HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT
6295-64301-0010 HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE
6295-64301-0011 LUDDY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR
6295-64301-0012 THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DIM INSTRUMENTS
6295-64301-0013 BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MARRY A MUSIC
6295-64301-0014 I SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE
6295-64301-0015 HER HEART SEEMED TO SWALLOW UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING
6295-64301-0016 A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOATED FREELY
6295-64301-0017 REDDY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC
6295-64301-0018 LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HUNT THE WORLD
6295-64301-0019 IT CRIED LOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM
6295-64301-0020 NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUS OF THE MUSICIAN
6295-64301-0021 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRY THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
6295-64301-0022 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE PART OF A LOVE GOD
6295-64301-0023 WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLOOMIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE
6295-64301-0024 HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL I LOVE GOD WHOM HE HAS NOT SEEN
6295-64301-0025 A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MARY'S BOSOM
6295-64301-0026 THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM ASSURPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE IN DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
6295-64301-0027 HE STARTED TO CAUTIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
6295-64301-0028 HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THAT THEN SOMEHOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
6295-64301-0029 IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT APART FROM THE BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
6295-64301-0030 HIS VIOLENCE WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
6295-64301-0031 HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIMSELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD
6295-64301-0032 IT IS JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED
6313-66125-0000 YOU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CLEAR
6313-66125-0001 LOOKS LIKE A STUMP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AIN'T SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT

6313-66125-0011 BE SURE TO FASTEN HIM SECURELY TO THE LOO BEFORE YOU GIVE THE SIGNAL TO HALL UP WARM THE GUIDE
6313-66125-0012 ARE YOU ALREADY YES
6313-66125-0013 HE TOPPED HIS HEAD TO LOOK UP
6313-66125-0014 THE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWAYING ITDILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
6313-66125-0015 CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCK THE CITY HIMSELF HAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT BE TO BE TOO CURIOUS
6313-66125-0016 SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYON
6313-66125-0017 AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM OURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE DEPTHS REACHED THEIR EARS
6313-66125-0018 LIFE QUICKLY MAKE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE

6313-66125-0022 LIES LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF A THIN ARC OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TORCH IN TAD'S HAND
6313-66125-0023 BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS BOOTMENTS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY

6313-66125-0027 NOR WAS THE SENSE OF SECURITY INCREASED WHEN IN SHIFT IN HIS POSITION THE TORCH FELL FROM HIS GRASP THE FAGETS SCATTERING AS A SLIPP DOWN BETWEEN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE AND WHIRLING IN EVER DIMINISHING CIRCLES UNTIL FINALLY HE HEARD THEM PLATTER ON THE ROCKS BELOW
6313-66129-0000 HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME TIME WITH HIM
6313-66129-0001 WITH A SHOUT THE BOY DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROWS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS ON THE ANIMAL'S FLANKS

6313-66129-0015 AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY WRITING WITH THEIR PENNIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
6313-66129-0016 THEY BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
6313-66129-0017 THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NEDS AND THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMY WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE
