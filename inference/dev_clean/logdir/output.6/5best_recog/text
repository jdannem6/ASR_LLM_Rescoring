5694-64029-0004 THE ANTIQUIC LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
5694-64029-0005 I AM A VIVIDETTE YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SUCCESS ON HIS WORD BOTH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIDE OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FATE AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLASS OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN
5694-64029-0010 HE DEVICED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANC UPON US
5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGION ABOUT DARK WE WERE JOINED OUR REGIMENT
5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONES RIVER ON THE YANKE SIDE
5694-64029-0014 MAD GENERALSHIP BY THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
5694-64029-0015 THE PROPHET GOOD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
5694-64029-0016 I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME AND OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK
5694-64029-0017 THE YANKEE MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDERED TOWARD TO THE ATTACK
5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WORKERS AND TURN PIKE
5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SEES FIRE AND YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MAN SEES FIRING YOU WERE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
5694-64029-0021 OAKLY COLORED BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE AKY LINE WITH HIS COLLARS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
5694-64029-0022 THE LEDEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND REFORMED
5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEEM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR LAWS
5694-64029-0025 I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN THROUGH MY SHOULDER
5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALARM
5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAT GREAT GOD
5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ALONG AND ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
5694-64029-0029 BUT HE COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONED DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK
5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YONKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETS HAD GONE IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK
5694-64038-0000 ADVANC INTO TENNESSE
5694-64038-0001 YAK SAYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING JOHNNIE
5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED AROUND AT LANA CROSSED THE CHANHI AND TRAVELLED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSON
5694-64038-0003 OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVITING ARMY
5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LIFE OR MAY BE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS
5694-64038-0006 A YAKE HE ALL SAYS NAGGER
5694-64038-0007 THEY PERSUADED ELOQUETLY
5694-64038-0008 THE MAN IN THE WELL
5694-64038-0009 THE VOICE BEGAN TO BE OVERHEAD
5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON SETTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WALL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVEED PROBLEM
5694-64038-0012 THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WEALTH ALL NIGHT
5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEARLY
5694-64038-0014 I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BUT BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
5694-64038-0015 WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSI SIDE OF TENNESSE RIVER
5694-64038-0016 WE A BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARDS THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
5694-64038-0018 WE WERE INERT TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE AND EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE AND EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY AND EVERY DEFEAT
5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BY AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GIRL
5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER A WHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN I GANY THE LAW
5694-64038-0021 YO SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW
5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURPHRY SPARROW PIKE
5694-64038-0024 A REGIMENT WAS SAID TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT
5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT UP BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
5895-34615-0000 BUT HIS LAUGHTER A SYNANIM OF JOY
5895-34615-0001 SUCH PROPHET COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE
5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF INTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT
5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANNIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY ACCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION
5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS OF MOUNTEBANK
5895-34615-0006 SHE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWENDOLEN'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
5895-34615-0008 THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEFEND ON THE INTERIOR
5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICKUS
5895-34615-0010 ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE SPACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT
5895-34615-0011 AN EVERLASTING LOVE
5895-34615-0012 THE MANICIANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
5895-34615-0013 THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPPED
5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS RECEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING
5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAY THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENCE TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANNAESTIA
5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GIMNIST AND AN ATHLETE
5895-34615-0018 GWYNPLAINED HAD YELLOW HAIR
5895-34615-0019 HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DIED WITH SOME CONROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MAIN THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOTAL IN STORIES
5895-34622-0001 AND GWYNPLAINE'S EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
5895-34622-0002 WHATEVER WAS THIS NOTHING
5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN NINE O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
5895-34622-0004 THE QUEERS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIREGROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TWO PENNED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS GUARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOT INTO A THEATOR
5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACE ALL THAT HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT
5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN APPROACHING
5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSSFRED ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF AFFAIRS AND FATES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACED EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATION OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SO SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE RED PHEEBE AND VENUS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
5895-34622-0015 PHOEBE COOKED VENUS GROBED THE TEMPLE
5895-34622-0016 URSUS AND HOWMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS IN GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONION FROM EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0019 A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAMP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
5895-34622-0020 URBSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
5895-34622-0021 THAN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITENERANT PURITAN CREATURES WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
5895-34622-0023 URSUS WASN'T EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY AND THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWIK
5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSTUS
5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL IS A SAY ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED SEVEN ONLY BY THE ARTIST'S DOOR
5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WANTED FOR THE GREEN BOX
5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATRE READY MAID
5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THIS WALLS WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES PHEBE AND SOMETIMES FAMOUS
5895-34629-0009 WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URBSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
5895-34629-0010 THEY BEGUN THEIR PERFORMANCES
5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO AMOUNT TOBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTH WORK RUN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MEN
5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS IN MOUNTEBANKS OF TOTANZO FIELD WERE A GASTIC GWYNPLAINE
5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THE PUBLIC
5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRIGHT THE SWALLOWERS OF SWARDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKEERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS COMMUNITY OF JAWS AND CAUSE WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
5895-34629-0017 THE SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHADSPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASS LONDON BRIDGE
5895-34629-0020 EACH WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS
5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHW WORK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC DOCUMENTS
5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREAS THEIR SUCCESS
5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOIS'ER WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MEN
5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC A PAUSE GREW INTO ACLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTER PEACE OF URSUS
5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO MARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
5895-34629-0029 THERE HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NEGLECT STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
5895-34629-0031 WHAT THE PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCCOUNDREL
5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIRGROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REALING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
6241-61943-0000 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP BALKERY
6241-61943-0001 BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCES MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER
6241-61943-0002 WELL AND HAVE WE A SPARE WIND
6241-61943-0003 MY ALKA WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET
6241-61943-0004 BUT NO GHOST TO ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
6241-61943-0005 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE WAS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENARK
6241-61943-0006 NO MISTER HARD PIG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
6241-61943-0007 AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GETT THERE SOME DAY
6241-61943-0008 ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNTAIN MAJORL'S YOKELE WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
6241-61943-0009 THE VULGARE KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD
6241-61943-0010 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WELLS AND SHARKS
6241-61943-0011 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE AS LAND
6241-61943-0012 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT AFFECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL
6241-61943-0013 THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO A SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
6241-61943-0014 HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BEARING TRAMP
6241-61943-0015 THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHICH HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
6241-61943-0016 THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELAND AND LATIN
6241-61943-0017 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WOULD AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6241-61943-0018 NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS ON GOES WELL THE WORSE DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
6241-61943-0019 IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NO AN HOUR TO LOSE
6241-61943-0020 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SACK NUISOME
6241-61943-0021 I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULTE THEM
6241-61943-0022 THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT IN DUTY
6241-61943-0023 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKEWISE TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES
6241-61943-0024 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PAST OR IN CONGREGATION
6241-61943-0025 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASP GROWS IN THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
6241-61943-0026 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRAWING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
6241-61943-0027 THE MEN APPEARED ROBEAST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MEAN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LATTER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESKIMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POOR CIRCLE
6241-61946-0000 I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
6241-61946-0001 HANS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH THE STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP
6241-61946-0002 ARE TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WIP OR SPUR
6241-61946-0003 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FORE PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTH WEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VENACULAR IS CALLED SUDVEST FEUDINGER
6241-61946-0004 WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARST MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE OFFER EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
6241-61946-0005 THEY VERY BARELY SUCCEEDED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
6241-61946-0006 I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED SCENT TAR
6241-61946-0007 SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACTABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
6241-61946-0008 WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OR WORTHY GUIDE
6241-61946-0009 I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF ENTERPRISE
6241-61946-0010 MY ARMS WERE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
6241-61946-0011 HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN IN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BIRD OR ICELAND A HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LIVING LIKE BEGGARS IN THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
6241-61946-0012 A FEW STRAIGHT HOUSE AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
6241-61946-0013 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNUFFELS WHERE A GLUMMORATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
6241-61946-0014 THAT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
6241-61946-0015 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDER WAS TO BE FOUND
6241-61946-0016 THESE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHS AND NEVER MISS THEM
6241-61946-0017 TO RID OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
6241-61946-0018 IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN HERS
6241-61946-0019 BUT MY UNKLE WASN'T NO HUMOUR TO WAIT
6241-61946-0020 AT LENGTH THE STARTY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COSSACKS OF ROADS
6241-61946-0021 HE SAYS TIED REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE ENGLISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
6241-61946-0022 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE SHORE FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
6241-61946-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FAIRY BOATS OF THE ELB I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOWCOMOTION
6241-66616-0000 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR ON FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
6241-66616-0001 ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WILL BIGGE A ONE'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
6241-66616-0002 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A AWAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
6241-66616-0003 A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WINDOW AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
6241-66616-0004 THREE DAYS LATER MINIATALI BECAME NOSON'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
6241-66616-0005 FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEED WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNDER THE SECOND GENERATION
6241-66616-0006 MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEWCOMB AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
6241-66616-0007 THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND KNEW SOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINUTE TALKI
6241-66616-0008 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABBY RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETOCKI AS SHE BECAME ODOR DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
6241-66616-0009 WABY ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWOREY SINEWY AND AGILE AS A LINKS AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
6241-66616-0010 ONE OF NEW SOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MEN TALKY AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
6241-66616-0011 CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN POOR ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THIRDLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
6241-66616-0012 THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRAVE PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WHILE WE WAS SIXTEEN AND MANY A TALKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
6241-66616-0013 IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOUNDS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREADATIONS
6241-66616-0014 AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PLACE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
6241-66616-0015 BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINIATARKY AND HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0016 NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEAK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
6241-66616-0017 A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTRS PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
6241-66616-0018 BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WHILE HE WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINIATARKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0019 THEY WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY DEPARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
6241-66616-0020 SPRING CAME IN PATH AND THEN SUMMER
6241-66616-0021 WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN INTO CHOICE IN THREE YEARS
6241-66616-0022 WE WILL HUNT RULES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN
6241-66616-0023 THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WHERE THEY GO ON'S REPLY
6241-66616-0024 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET RID AT SPRUCE WOOD ON THE BLACK STAIRS RIVER
6241-66616-0025 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF BOB'S LETTER FOUND RAWDON HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE

6295-244435-0002 BUT THE MOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE A VICTORY ONLY
6295-244435-0003 BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORWARD AND THE SHORE
6295-244435-0004 THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER THE HARBOR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ETED SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
6295-244435-0005 THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SOME DEAR IS OURS
6295-244435-0006 BUT THE NEGOTIATION WERE SOON COMPLETED
6295-244435-0007 ALL THEMINITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
6295-244435-0008 THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSE AND ARKENSA FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KUTUKI A MEZURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE

6295-244435-0010 THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH IN LOYALTY
6295-244435-0011 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLOW
6295-244435-0012 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FEVER THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
6295-244435-0013 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF OCEAN SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT
6295-244435-0014 BORGARD AT ONCE WROTE AN ORDER
6295-244435-0015 COLONEL KANTTON WRITES WISELY
6295-244435-0016 WE NEED KANTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
6295-244435-0017 HENRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DE LENNA'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE
6295-244435-0018 HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOLD HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE
6295-244435-0019 HAIRRY GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
6295-244435-0020 WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS BRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPE THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
6295-244435-0021 IT WAS A DIFFERENT HAIRY WHO STARTED HOME LAID IN APRIL
6295-244435-0022 FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED IN BRAVE
6295-244435-0023 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS THAT HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM
6295-244435-0024 HE GAZED UPON THE WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS
6295-244435-0025 BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VIOLET ON THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
6295-244435-0026 IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND THORLAGE
6295-244435-0027 WHO WAS GOING HOME AFTER VICTORY
6295-244435-0028 HE SOON LEFT CHARLES THEN OUT OF SIGHT
6295-244435-0029 HE FELT THE ENTRANCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE
6295-244435-0030 PEOPLE WERE COOLER HEAR AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
6295-244435-0031 THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SELF CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANK TO IT
6295-244435-0032 IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CHRISTS
6295-244435-0033 IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WIND AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIGH STRENGTH AND AGILITY
6295-244435-0034 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES AN OLD KNTUCKY
6295-244435-0035 BILL SKILL AND HIS GANG THAT MOUNTAINEERS WERE UP
6295-244435-0036 HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A POST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERY MAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
6295-244435-0037 IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID FRANZ
6295-244435-0038 HARRY THANKED HIM THROUGH HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVINGMAN RODE AWAY
6295-244435-0039 THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HE KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
6295-244435-0040 BUT HE SAW NOTHING BUT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
6295-64301-0000 ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR TASTE BRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
6295-64301-0001 IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLIE
6295-64301-0002 WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTBATH
6295-64301-0003 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLENT CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
6295-64301-0004 EARTH WAS GONE AND HELEN WAS ALL
6295-64301-0005 LEST AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESS SHALL I BE THERE THEN
6295-64301-0006 WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOLMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLOURS
6295-64301-0007 JUST THEN HE WAS OF NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS
6295-64301-0008 THE NETTLE ARE THE DARK SAID JOSEPH
6295-64301-0009 HE WAS INT A MOOD FROM MUSIC WAS HE NOT
6295-64301-0010 HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARMCHAIR BY THE FIRE
6295-64301-0011 REDDY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR
6295-64301-0012 THE MUSIC WAS BROKE AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS
6295-64301-0013 BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MERRY IN MUSIC
6295-64301-0014 THEY SATE DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE
6295-64301-0015 HER HEART SEEMED TO SWEAR UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING
6295-64301-0016 A LITTLE LONGER IN SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY
6295-64301-0017 LEDDY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC
6295-64301-0018 LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD IS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD
6295-64301-0019 IT TRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM
6295-64301-0020 NEITHER WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN
6295-64301-0021 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CROWD THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
6295-64301-0022 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE PART OF THE LOVE GOD
6295-64301-0023 WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLIMMERIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE

6295-64301-0025 A SOB LIKE A BIRDU BORN BURST FROM MARY'S BOSOM
6295-64301-0026 THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM ASSERPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
6295-64301-0027 HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONCLUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
6295-64301-0028 HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO BUT THEN SOME HOUSE STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
6295-64301-0029 IN THE ACTIVE RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
6295-64301-0030 HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
6295-64301-0031 HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIS SELF AND A WOMAN GIVING HIM INSTEAD

6313-66125-0015 CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCK TO STUDY HIMSELF HAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT BE TO BE TOO CURIOUS
6313-66125-0016 SLOWLY BUT SUDDENLY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYON
