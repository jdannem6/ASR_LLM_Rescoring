5694-64029-0004 THE INNCADE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
5694-64029-0005 I AM A VICTOR YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SATISFACTION ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEPS WOULD GET IT
5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GOWN
5694-64029-0010 HE DIVIDED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LYING AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE HAD JOINED OUR REGIMENT
5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OFSTONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
5694-64029-0014 BAD GENERALSHIP BYE THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
5694-64029-0015 THE PRIVATE COOK BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
5694-64029-0016 I CALL LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIRECY'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME AND OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK
5694-64029-0017 THE YANKES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDERED FOUR TO THE ATTACK
5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILTERS AND TURN PIPE
5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SEES FIRE AND YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MAN SEES FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
5694-64029-0021 OAKLY COLORED BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE ACKEY LINE WITH HIS COLLARS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HALE STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND REFORMED
5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEED EM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FLYING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
5694-64029-0025 I FELT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELDS HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAD GREAT GOD
5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR CROW
5694-64029-0029 BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT AND WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STORM DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK
5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKESE APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A KNIGHT ATTACK
5694-64038-0000 ADVANCE INTO TENNESSOE
5694-64038-0001 YAK SAYS WHAT DO YOU DO AND JOHNNIE
5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED AROUND AT LANA CROSSED THE CHANHI AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUT ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSON
5694-64038-0003 OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADED ARMY
5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FOR THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YENK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAY BE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED UP AND SAYS YELLOW BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS
5694-64038-0006 A YAKE HE ALLA SAYS NAGGER
5694-64038-0007 WE PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY
5694-64038-0008 A MAN ON THE WILL
5694-64038-0009 THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEADED
5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WILL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSALLEED PROBLEM
5694-64038-0012 THE PORT FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE FEAST WAS CLEAR
5694-64038-0014 I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LIGHTED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
5694-64038-0015 WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSY SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER
5694-64038-0016 WE AT BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART COULD THROB WITH THE EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
5694-64038-0018 WE WERE INURRED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE AND EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE AND EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT
5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND UNTIL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BY AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER A WHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN I GUINEA THE LAW
5694-64038-0021 YE SEE JIM KNEW THE LAW
5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT GIMBLET TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LOA THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURPHY BARREL A PIKE
5694-64038-0024 A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JOE'S REGIMENT
5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT TO BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
5895-34615-0000 BUT IS LAUGHTER A SINNANIME OF JOY
5895-34615-0001 SUCH PERFECT COMPLETNESS IS NOT IN NATURE
5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF A ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT
5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMITATION
5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS THE MOUNTEBANK
5895-34615-0006 YOU SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGHTER WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
5895-34615-0008 THE OUTSIDE DO NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR
5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICTRESS
5895-34615-0010 ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGRIVATED IT
5895-34615-0011 A EVERLASTING LAUGH
5895-34615-0012 THE MANICHEIANS BELIEVE THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ADICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
5895-34615-0013 THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT
5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWENDOLEN'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING
5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GRANDLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENCE TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANCEASA
5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GEMEST AND AN ATHLETE
5895-34615-0018 GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HARE
5895-34615-0019 HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CONROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANE THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THAT
5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD BEEN NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TALL AND STORIES
5895-34622-0001 IN GWYNPLAINE'S EQUAL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
5895-34622-0002 WHAT WAS THIS NOT
5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEENNO FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
5895-34622-0004 THE WIGWAMS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR ROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TWO PAINED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VOYAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED OATH INTO A THEATOR
5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND HIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT
5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN CLOSING
5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSSFORD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRIES AND FATES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE SPACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSIS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATION OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SO SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE READ PHEBE AND VENUS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
5895-34622-0015 PHOEBE COOKED VENUS SCRUB THE TEMPLE
5895-34622-0016 URSUS AND HOMMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BED CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS IN GWENDOLEN
5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THE THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITION FROM EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0019 A LIFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
5895-34622-0020 URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PLACES
5895-34622-0021 THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE THAT I AM
5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITONERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
5895-34622-0023 HERSUS WASN'T EVERYTHING IN THE PEACE AND THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHRIC
5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELAY TO URSUS
5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL IS A SANG ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED EVEN ONLY BY THE ARTIST'S DOOR
5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREAT BOX
5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATRE READY MIGHT
5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THE WALLS WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWENDOLENED THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES PHEEBE AND SOMETIMES VENOUS
5895-34629-0009 WE ARE IN LONDON SAYS URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
5895-34629-0010 THEY BEGIN THEIR PERFORMANCES
5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEDBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTH WORK MEN AND CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MEN
5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TOTTING ZOFIELD WERE A GASTIC GWYNPLAINE
5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THIS PUBLIC
5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWARDS AND THE GRIMOUS MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS IMMEDIATE OF JAWS AND CAUSE WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS WELL IT REMAINED LOCAL
5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAHKSPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOW PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
5895-34629-0020 THESE WERE REMARKABLE TOWNS
5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANNED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE PAUSE OF SOUTHWORK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC PROVIDENCE
5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTIING OF TAKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOISZER WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MEN
5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC PAUSE GREW INTO ACLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTER PEACE OF URSUS
5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MEN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
5895-34629-0029 THEY HAD A GREAT FUN IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SEEN WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICHOLAS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
5895-34629-0031 WHAT A PITY THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMAL SCOUNDREL
5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIRGROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME WHEELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
6241-61943-0000 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP VOLKORY
6241-61943-0001 BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO OFFER
6241-61943-0002 WELL AND HAVE WE FAIR WIND
6241-61943-0003 MY ALKWA WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET
6241-61943-0004 BUT NO GHOST THERE ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
6241-61943-0005 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE WAS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HERO PRINCE OF DENMARK
6241-61943-0006 NO MISTER HARD WIG SAYS THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
6241-61943-0007 AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME STAY
6241-61943-0008 ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNTAIN VIGIL'S YOKEAL WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
6241-61943-0009 THE VOLGRY KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD
6241-61943-0010 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WAALS AND SHARKS
6241-61943-0011 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEEST LAND
6241-61943-0012 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM COULD EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL
6241-61943-0013 THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS CROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
6241-61943-0014 HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BEARING TRAMP
6241-61943-0015 THE PROFESSOR KNEW THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
6241-61943-0016 THIS MODEST SCHOLARS SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATIN
6241-61943-0017 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WERE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6241-61943-0018 NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS OWN GOES WELL THE WORST DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
6241-61943-0019 IN THE MEAN MEANTIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
6241-61943-0020 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SAK NOSOM
6241-61943-0021 I I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT THEM
6241-61943-0022 THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT OWN DUTY
6241-61943-0023 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FAILED FOR CENTURIES
6241-61943-0024 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTER IN CONGREGATION
6241-61943-0025 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASP GROWS IN THE ROOF WHICH GRASSES CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
6241-61943-0026 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANCE DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRAWING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
6241-61943-0027 THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MEAN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LATTER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESKIMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE WHOLE CIRCLE
6241-61946-0000 I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELAY OF TRAVELLING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
6241-61946-0001 HANS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPIDLY UNVARYING STEP
6241-61946-0002 OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING LIP OR SPUR
6241-61946-0003 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FORE PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTH WEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VANACULAR IS CALLED SUDVEST FEUEDINGER
6241-61946-0004 WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSED MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
6241-61946-0005 THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEEDED ON A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
6241-61946-0006 I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED SON TAR
6241-61946-0007 SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACTABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
6241-61946-0008 WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT ART WORTHY GUIDE
6241-61946-0009 I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXPERIENCE
6241-61946-0010 MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STEEP
6241-61946-0011 HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN IN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BURER OR ICELAND A HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS IN THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
6241-61946-0012 A FEW STRAIGHT CALLS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
6241-61946-0013 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNUFFLES WHERE AGLMERATION OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
6241-61946-0014 IT CONSISTED SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
6241-61946-0015 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE REGARDTER WAS TO BE FOUND
6241-61946-0016 THESE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISSED THEM
6241-61946-0017 TO RIDE A REVOLT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
6241-61946-0018 IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN COUNTENANCE THAN THEIRS
6241-61946-0019 BUT MY UNCLE WASAN'T NO HUMOUR TO WAIT
6241-61946-0020 AT LENGTH THE STARTY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE LOSSES OF ROADS
6241-61946-0021 HE SAYS TIED REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DEARISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
6241-61946-0022 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THEFIELD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
6241-61946-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FAIRY BOATS OF THE ALB I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOOKCOMOTION
6241-66616-0000 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WHICH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
6241-66616-0001 ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WILL BEGO ONE'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
6241-66616-0002 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN AWAY ITS MEAN PURPOSE FAILED
6241-66616-0003 A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON LONDON AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
6241-66616-0004 THREE DAYS LATER MINIATALKI BECAME NURSON'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
6241-66616-0005 FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FUGUES IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEED WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNDER THE SECOND GENERATION
6241-66616-0006 MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEWIUM AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
6241-66616-0007 THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND KNEW SOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MEN A TALKING
6241-66616-0008 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABBY RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETOCKI AS SHE BECAME ODOUR DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
6241-66616-0009 WHILE BEYOND THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARDY SINEWY AND AGILE AS A LINKS AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
6241-66616-0010 ONE OF NEW SOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MEN HAD TALKING AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
6241-66616-0011 CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PAST IN POOR ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THIRDLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
6241-66616-0012 THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRAVE PUPILS AND BY THE TIME ROBY WAS SIXTEEN AND MANY A TALKEY TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
6241-66616-0013 IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOMENS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
6241-66616-0014 AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PURSE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
6241-66616-0015 BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNATALKI AND HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0016 SOCIETY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
6241-66616-0017 A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTUREORS PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
6241-66616-0018 BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WHILE HE WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNITALKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0019 THEY WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY HEARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
6241-66616-0020 SPRING CAME IN VAST AND THEN SUMMER
6241-66616-0021 WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN INTO TROID IN THREE YEARS
6241-66616-0022 WE WILL HUNT WOOLS THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKING
6241-66616-0023 THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WILL THEY GO ON REPLY
6241-66616-0024 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET RID AT SPRUCE WOOD ON THE BLACK STARGING RIVER
6241-66616-0025 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF HARVEY'S LETTER FOUND RAWDON HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
6295-244435-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN A HOME COMING
6295-244435-0001 COLONELLY AND I HIS TALBOT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
6295-244435-0002 BUT THE MOTIONS OF HARRI AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY
6295-244435-0003 BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORD END THE SHORE
6295-244435-0004 THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER THE HARBOR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ADD SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
6295-244435-0005 THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMPTOR IS OURS
6295-244435-0006 BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WAS SOON COMPLETED
6295-244435-0007 ALL THE IMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
6295-244435-0008 THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSE AND ARKENSA FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KUTUKI AND MIZURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
6295-244435-0009 LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTOWN THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURE
6295-244435-0010 THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT STAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY
6295-244435-0011 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF DREAM
6295-244435-0012 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVORITE THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
6295-244435-0013 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERY BODY WITH IT
6295-244435-0014 BORGARD AT ONCE WROTE IN ORDER
6295-244435-0015 COLONEL KINTEN WRITES WISELY
6295-244435-0016 WE NEED CUTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
6295-244435-0017 HENRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DOLNA'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE
6295-244435-0018 HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SIGHED HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE
6295-244435-0019 HARRIC GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
6295-244435-0020 WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GREAT OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
6295-244435-0021 IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LAID AN APRIL
6295-244435-0022 FOUR MONTHS HAVE MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED IN GRAVE
6295-244435-0023 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF EM
6295-244435-0024 HE GAZED UPON A WORLDFUL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS
6295-244435-0025 BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VULGAR ON THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
6295-244435-0026 IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW AND FLOWERS AND FARLAGE
6295-244435-0027 IT WAS GOING HOME AFTER VICTORY
6295-244435-0028 HE SOON LEFT CHARLES THE OUT OF SIGHT
6295-244435-0029 HE FELT THE INDIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE
6295-244435-0030 PEOPLE WERE SCHOOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
6295-244435-0031 THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SELF CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TAME TO IT
6295-244435-0032 IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CRSTS
6295-244435-0033 IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTER AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIGN STRENGTH AND AGILITY
6295-244435-0034 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES AN OLD CONCUCKY
6295-244435-0035 BILL SKILL AND HIS GANG THE MOUNTAINEERS WERE UP
6295-244435-0036 HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY OF AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERY MAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
6295-244435-0037 IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLUMNS
6295-244435-0038 HARRY THANKED HIM THROUGH HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVERYMEN RODE AWAY
6295-244435-0039 THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST EVERYBODY ELSE
6295-244435-0040 BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT REMOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
6295-64301-0000 ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOL IN SET OUT FOR TEST BRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
6295-64301-0001 THIS WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY
6295-64301-0002 WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS IT STRODE ALONG THE FOOTPATH
6295-64301-0003 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLUN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
6295-64301-0004 EARTH WAS DRAWN AND HEAVEN WAS ALL
6295-64301-0005 BLESS AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLUSH SHALL I BE THERE THEN
6295-64301-0006 WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOPES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLOURS
6295-64301-0007 JUST THEN HE WAS A NEW MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS
6295-64301-0008 THE NETTLE IN THE DOG SAID JOSEPH
6295-64301-0009 HE WAS A MOOD FROM MUSIC WAS HE NOT
6295-64301-0010 HE LAID DOWN HIS VILE IN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE
6295-64301-0011 LEDDY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR
6295-64301-0012 THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DOZEN INSTRUMENTS
6295-64301-0013 BUT IN HIS HANDS MULTITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC
6295-64301-0014 THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN VIOLENCE
6295-64301-0015 HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM LEAPING
6295-64301-0016 A LITTLE LONGER WHEN SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY
6295-64301-0017 SHE TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC
6295-64301-0018 LET BUT A MOVEMENT BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD
6295-64301-0019 IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITIES WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM
6295-64301-0020 NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THINGOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN
6295-64301-0021 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THAT VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
6295-64301-0022 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE POWER OF A LOVE GOD
6295-64301-0023 WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE INQUIRIIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE
6295-64301-0024 HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL I LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEMED
6295-64301-0025 A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MIRY'S BOSOM
6295-64301-0026 THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM ASSIRPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE IN DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
6295-64301-0027 HE STARTLED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
6295-64301-0028 HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THAT THEN SOMEHOUSE STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
6295-64301-0029 IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TERRING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
6295-64301-0030 HIS VIOLENT WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
6295-64301-0031 HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIS ITSELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD
6295-64301-0032 HE JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED
6313-66125-0000 YOU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CHAIR

6313-66125-0012 ARE YOU READY YET
6313-66125-0013 HE TUMBLED HIS HEAD TO LOOK UP
6313-66125-0014 THE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWAYING BITTERLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
6313-66125-0015 CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCK TO SUDDENLY HIMSELF HAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT BE TO BE TOO CURIOUS
6313-66125-0016 SLOWLY BUT SUDDENLY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID IT TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYON
6313-66125-0017 AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP FALL FROM THE DEPTHS REACHED THEIR EARS
6313-66125-0018 LIVES QUICKLY MAKE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE

6313-66125-0023 BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS BLUEMENTS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY

6313-66129-0000 HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME COMMON WITH HIM
6313-66129-0001 WITH A SHOUT THE BOY DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROWS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLIPS ON THE ANIMAL'S FLANKS

6313-66129-0015 AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY WRITING WITH THEIR BONNIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
6313-66129-0016 THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS LITTLE OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
