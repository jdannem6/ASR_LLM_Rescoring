7850-111771-0008 WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SUNDAY JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS
7850-111771-0009 HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY ANDABILITY TO REFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTED LABOUR WITHOUT FATIGUE
7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BURDOCKANS
7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT ANNOUNCED AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
7850-281318-0002 AND THERE IS AN ODD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
7850-281318-0003 OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR THE HOME
7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS BRUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIT
7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLIPS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
7850-281318-0007 THEN SHE SAW ALL THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY
7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASKER TO TEACH US
7850-281318-0009 SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPING TWINITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
7850-281318-0010 OH WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING LATE AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A FAINT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH WORDS PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST
7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEYAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
7850-281318-0014 AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTLED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
7850-281318-0015 I HAD THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
7850-281318-0016 CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACK DOW
7850-281318-0017 HERE WOULD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLAY SO STICKS THROUGH END ACROSS CRISS CROSS SOW
7850-281318-0018 CHRIST CROSS GRISS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON
7850-281318-0019 YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH THEIR NESTS BY YOURSELVES
7850-281318-0020 MUCH LACK MAY YOU HAVE
7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSINESS IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON VAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WOOD PICKEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CHRIST CROSS AS THE MAGBY HAD SHOWN HER
7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FINE OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
7850-286674-0001 IT IS SUCCESSFUL
7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRIGING UP AT ALL
7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER APE TREE MEALS
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS A PIECE AND THREE JOYS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GERLLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LADY
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NICHOLL
7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T WONDER
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHEES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTENED PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS A JOINT AND HOLDS HIS SLIPP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
7850-286674-0012 SCARED BA WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES A HAPPY DIRT ALL
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHEEL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAMP AFTER HIS DINNER
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAWN HIS LEGS THERE VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCH THE MUD THE LAST LAVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
7850-286674-0017 THE GYMPS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
7850-73752-0000 FERDINA MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE
7850-73752-0001 IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING A LIKE SUNBURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE
7850-73752-0002 IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE
7850-73752-0003 THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FORDINAND OUR MINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUSMEERBEL WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVERCOMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
7850-73752-0004 FORDINAN FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS
7850-73752-0005 WAS INDEED HER HANDWRITING
7850-73752-0006 RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANED OVER THE BALASTRATE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY
7850-73752-0007 HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHE THE GOOD
7850-73752-0008 FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORDLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BESTINGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET
7850-73752-0009 THE MOST SHIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
7850-73752-0010 HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLUSHINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA
7850-73752-0011 HIS SUBSTANCEY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED
7850-73752-0012 AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FEVER MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM
7850-73752-0013 IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON IT VOLCANO
7850-73752-0014 AND NOW ALL HEAD ENDED SO HAPPILY
7850-73752-0015 WAS IT NOT ALL THE DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER
7850-73752-0016 HE MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TELLSTMAN
7850-73752-0017 IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOSE HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME
7850-73752-0018 IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WARE AND TERROR OF PLAY THE RECCRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVIN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR UNDER THE CEDARS OF LAVANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATTONIA
7850-73752-0019 IS PAPA ALONE INQUIRED MISS SIMPLE
7976-105575-0000 GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH THE COMMANDER AND CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FALK BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
7976-105575-0001 MY OWN JUDGMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE
7976-105575-0002 OUR DRAGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED
7976-105575-0003 THERE WERE NO BREAST WORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE GREAT OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED THE ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT
7976-105575-0004 NOT BY THE CLOVER NOR THE ALMA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS THE DUEL TO THE DEATH
7976-105575-0005 NO BATTLE IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WORE LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME
7976-105575-0006 ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY BEE WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
7976-105575-0007 THAT NIGHT THE ANIMAL SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD
7976-105575-0008 WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE NED WERE LEFT TILL MORNING
7976-105575-0009 IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF WHO WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT
7976-105575-0010 THIRTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
7976-105575-0011 I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH THE COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR GENIE KING
7976-105575-0012 HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION AND MISSISSIPPI
7976-105575-0013 WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GAINED THE WORST OF IT TOO
7976-105575-0014 THAT EVENING AND ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO INSULT THE ENEMIES LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT
7976-105575-0015 UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS RUBBLE ARMY
7976-105575-0016 ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISSUINGO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHUT THROUGH THE BREAST
7976-105575-0017 I COULDN NOT HELP MY FRIEND
7976-105575-0018 GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID LAUGHING ALL WILL BE NEEDED
7976-105575-0019 MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED ABOUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE
7976-105575-0020 I HESITATED BACK TO THE LINES
7976-105575-0021 THE CLOUD OF REVELES WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
7976-105575-0022 A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOIT THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS
7976-105575-0023 THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF THOUSANDS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS
7976-105575-0024 THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLE FIELD AMONG THE UN VERY DEAD
7976-105575-0025 INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE AND GRANT IN THOSE DAYS
7976-105575-0026 ROSE CRANANCE PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN
7976-105575-0027 IT REQUIRED MONTH AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARDS BECAME
7976-105575-0028 FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD OF HATCHEIE BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED
7976-105575-0029 A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT WHOLES WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR
7976-110124-0000 LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT YOU HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
7976-110124-0001 EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON COUNT
7976-110124-0002 HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MADE COME UPON YOU
7976-110124-0003 WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LET HIS BAND INTO A NEAR BY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
7976-110124-0004 HAVE PITY ON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT
7976-110124-0005 LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO CAST THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF
7976-110124-0006 IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT AND TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
7976-110124-0007 YOU IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID
7976-110124-0008 IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT
7976-110124-0009 BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRY THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
7976-110124-0010 HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BAGGER
7976-110124-0011 IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND WAY A BIGGER SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING
7976-110124-0012 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BIGGER HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POUND OVER THEM
7976-110124-0013 THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGNESS COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY
7976-110124-0014 SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING PARLOUR HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK
7976-110124-0015 THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNGOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE
7976-110124-0016 IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBED CHIEFTAIN
7976-110124-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN OUTWOOD HER YET CRIED ANOTHER
7976-110124-0018 THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT HER AND CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
7976-110124-0019 I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO DO YOU NO HARM
7976-110124-0020 YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER''S HOUSE
7976-110124-0021 HAVE THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER
7976-110124-0022 WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HALL IN DOOR
7976-110124-0023 THE CRIES AND CURSES AND THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR
7976-110124-0024 THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT ORDERS
7976-110124-0025 ALL MY WERERIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH
7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY DREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
7976-110523-0001 HOW COULD WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN YOU MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAN THE COFFINS FOR US
7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PIECES TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
7976-110523-0004 AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBIARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID HANDSOME I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE
7976-110523-0006 BUT IN REALITY CONSEIL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVI AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEP MOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PEACE
7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEAR WOODS AND IN THE EVENING WHEN YOU ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
7976-110523-0010 HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE RACHEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PAIN OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO ARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE
7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK UP HANDEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
7976-110523-0014 GRANDMOTHER BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
7976-110523-0015 GRITHLE SHE CRIED IN AN PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANDSOME FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
7976-110523-0016 DEAR GOOD GOD HELPST NOW SHE PRAYED
7976-110523-0017 CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GUT HILL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANDSOME
7976-110523-0018 SEE I COULD EVEN GET IT MYSELF
7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE COVEN
7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHEREIN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
7976-110523-0021 THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND WASHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
8297-275154-0000 NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENEDICT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME READILY THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SIDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
8297-275154-0001 THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CREWE WAS OVER
8297-275154-0002 THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANBLE
8297-275154-0003 RANDLE WAITED WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENEDET MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT
8297-275154-0004 HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OFSIDEANUM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM

8297-275154-0008 YOU DISCUSS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
8297-275154-0009 HE DRANK THE LINE GREEDILY
8297-275154-0010 WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT ALWAYS HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
8297-275154-0011 HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS KEEPING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
8297-275154-0012 RANLE HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SIDNEY IS
8297-275154-0013 I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE ANOTHER
8297-275154-0014 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY ADDRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
8297-275154-0015 I'M ALONE DO YOU KNOW THAT ALONE
8297-275154-0016 I HAVE UNCONSCIOUS ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF

8297-275154-0020 HE PAUSEED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FAVOURITE HEAD
8297-275154-0021 WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER STRAIN OF THOUGHT

8297-275155-0031 ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
8297-275155-0032 WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH THE MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER IN ANXIETY ABOUT SIDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN

8297-275156-0003 NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIPIN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND ONCE MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY
8297-275156-0004 SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUTH
8297-275156-0005 IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESBY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
8297-275156-0006 HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SIDY AN INTERVIEW
8297-275156-0007 EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENYCK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SIDEHAM
8297-275156-0008 BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT VANAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
8297-275156-0009 CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKEN THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND

8297-275156-0011 SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FOR YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO TOMORROW
8297-275156-0012 HE ADDED SIDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
8297-275156-0013 BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSE ABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY
84-121123-0000 GO GO DO YOU HEAR
84-121123-0001 BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROUND BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT
84-121123-0002 AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTERED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOOD SHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILLIPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY
84-121123-0003 AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS POORNESS IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE
84-121123-0004 DVINY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE
84-121123-0005 DAVINGY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN
84-121123-0006 FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOMBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS
84-121123-0007 WHAT DO DO YOU MEAN SIR
84-121123-0008 OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVOURING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I WAVE
84-121123-0009 DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORNELE
84-121123-0010 NATIER LOOKED UPON MORAL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VOLUNTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
84-121123-0011 SAID MORAL SADLY YES REPLIED NOIRTIER
84-121123-0012 THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAIN FIXED ON THE DOOR
84-121123-0013 ASKED WORLD YES

84-121123-0015 BUT CAN HE STAND YOU YES
84-121123-0016 GENTLEMAN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOUR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOR EVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK
84-121123-0017 MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR A REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER
84-121123-0018 CARLYLE SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM
84-121123-0019 THE OLD MAN MADE A SCENE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
84-121123-0020 IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF ROIRTIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED ON HIS CHEEKS
84-121123-0021 BUT HE SLEPT ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER
84-121123-0022 THE TWO DOCTOR'S THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE
84-121123-0023 NAIRTIER WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE
84-121123-0024 THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOTHED THE LIPS
84-121123-0025 THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN VALET WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS
84-121123-0026 D'ARTAGNAN SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I WILL SEEK YOU AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM
84-121123-0027 I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE MY WILL YOU NOT
84-121123-0028 I AM GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FURVENT THAN MINE
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHEMES
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTHMOST LIMPIT ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PRECEDINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE SHOWN SO GREAT ALIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
84-121550-0004 YE ARE NO COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE HER ADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELING BUT THE SOLEMN DELICTOSSY GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOAD YOUR INTELLECT
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOUL IN ITSELF DE LIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANDSOME OF ETERNAL PEACE
84-121550-0007 BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SUJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAVED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER THOUGHTS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
84-121550-0010 NOR EVEN THUS A WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
84-121550-0011 NOW HALEKIN MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR ERONIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT INVERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
84-121550-0012 THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SOCEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCE BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DEALIOUS GIRDLE
84-121550-0014 THESE STANDARDS TO THE REAR WORD LONGER WORTH THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WHERE THE OUTER MOST APART
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FORE CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR EIR GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHALE IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FLASHED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE GATE EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERVENTED
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VAINLY SPONSE OF DELY BONO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH EIR FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
84-121550-0023 TO THE LEFT HAND I RETURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
84-121550-0024 TO SAY UNTO VER JULIUS NOT A DROP WHOM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
84-121550-0025 DAWN DAY BECAUSE WHERE JULIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET A WHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEEDST MUST WEEP
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO EWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
84-121550-0027 LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH UN BEATRICE
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NO NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND NOBLE BE OF ONE MEASURE
84-121550-0030 BUT BY THE LARGE JEST OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR REIGN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGE LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALL READY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION
84-121550-0033 CONFUSED AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
84-121550-0034 WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVELY OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALARMANCE OR WHAT ADVANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHER SHEWED THAT THOU SHOULD TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
8842-302196-0000 HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF PALMS BY THE ITALIANS CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE AVERSION OF THE WHOLE VITINWAVA PROSE AND VERSE
8842-302196-0001 THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF COSETTEIE TO RANK AS A POETIC TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT
8842-302196-0002 THE LIFE BLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THIS COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD CALM SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE
8842-302196-0003 THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FROM PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRESH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW OF FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY
8842-302196-0004 POETRY NOT BEING IN EXACT SCIENCE LITERATUREITY OF RENDERING IS ALTOGETHER SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW
8842-302196-0005 OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIUM EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CATENT SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHORS STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF AS DANZA MUST BE WEAKEN TO ADOPT SOME RHME WHICH WILL TELL HE AND HE SEES THE POET REVELLING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SCANTLY SUPPLIED
8842-302196-0006 AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYSITIES OF THE PALM WHICH I OMITTED
8842-302196-0007 ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH HE WROTE MANY OF MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THIRDLY PERFORMED
8842-302196-0008 MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE PAULTRY AND USELESS
8842-302196-0009 IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF
8842-302196-0010 THROUGHOUT THE UTENWAVA THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA
8842-302196-0011 A WORD SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DANTAZ AUTOBIOGRAPHY
8842-302196-0012 THIS HAS INDUCED SOME EDITORS OF THE VIDONWAVA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE
8842-302201-0000 THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED AND ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN ANDVERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
8842-302201-0001 WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERS TIMES AND MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
8842-302201-0002 BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT A LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
8842-302201-0003 AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MAY BE ATTITUDE THERE WHEN MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME
8842-302201-0004 THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOWFALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGHS
8842-302201-0005 AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE HAD SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGNED
8842-302201-0006 WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE TO ISSUE THEMCE AND FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART STEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE
8842-302201-0007 TO HER I WENT ALONE IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS HAS MADE STRONG
8842-302201-0008 SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADIES LOVE
8842-302201-0009 THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SON I KNOW
8842-302201-0010 THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTOFORE
8842-302201-0011 IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINT HARDEDNESS
8842-302201-0012 AND THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO HIM
8842-302201-0013 IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADYIES DESIRED
8842-302201-0014 THE SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER IS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELIEVING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL AND THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRIEDING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVESATH CONCERNING HER
8842-302201-0015 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE WOMAN I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE
8842-302203-0000 AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSENED WHICH CAUGHT OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SET UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD
8842-302203-0001 AND SO STRONG WAS MY FANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE O EXCELLENT SAW HOW BLESS IT IS HE THAT NOW LOOK AT UPON THEE
8842-302203-0002 WHERE BY OTHER LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOMENT THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS OF MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEN SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SAYING SLEEP NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED
8842-302203-0003 WHEN BEING AROUSED I OPENED MINE EYES AND KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPION
8842-302203-0004 AND MY VIEW WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY OR LET US COMFORT HIM THEN UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT HATH SHAKEN THEE SO MUCH
8842-302203-0005 AND THERE WITH ALL SUCH A BEWILDER THAT POSSESSED ME THAT I SHUT MINE EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASE ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY HEALTHFUL THING
8842-302203-0006 THEN SAW I MANY BROKEN HINTED SIGHTS AND THE UNCERTAIN STAGE I STEPPED INTO
8842-302203-0007 THESE WONDERING FANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DEAD
8842-302203-0008 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HEAR I WAS A THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TWO
8842-302203-0009 THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JONE BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS CALLED OF MANY BUT HE MAVAEA SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM
8842-302203-0010 AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN I CHANCED TO LOOK THE WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JONE AND BEATRICE APPROACHING ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND MARVEL INSTANTLY
8842-302203-0011 THE SECOND PARTY BEGINS HERE SAYING BE NOW THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE
8842-304647-0000 HE LIVES THY LOSS HE DIES FROM EVERY LIMB MANGLED BY THEE LIGHTNINGS OF GOD HEADS SHINE FROM WHICH THY DARKNESS HATH NOT WHERE TO HIDE
8842-304647-0001 QUEEN SHE IMPASED US TO BEAUTY
8842-304647-0002 AND FLESH WAS RAIMENTED HOW HE WAS KILLED AND BURIED FROM THE DEAD HOW HE AROSE TO LIFE WITH VICTORY AND REIGNED IN HEAVEN HOW ALL OF US SHALL BE GLORIOUS LIKE HIM WHOSE HEARTS TO HIS ARE WED HOW THEY WHO DIE FOR LOVE OF REASON GIVE HYPOCRITES TYRANTS SOPHISTS ALL WHO SELL THEIR NEIGHBOURS ILL FOR HOLINESS TO HELL HOW THE DEADS SAINT CONDEMNS THE BAD WHO LIVE AS TO HELL HOW HELL HOW HE DOES BECOMES A LAW FOR HELLINGNESS TO HELL HOW HELL HOW TO JUDGE SHALL COME AGAIN
8842-304647-0003 THIS WORLD'S THICK VAPOURS WELM YOUR EYES UNWORTHY OF THAT GLORIOUS SHOW BLIND HIS SPLENDOUR BENT UPON HIS SHAME
8842-304647-0004 MONEY IS FALSE AND LIGHT UNLESS IT BE BOUGHT BY A MAN'S OWN WORTHY QUALITIES IN BLOOD IS SUCH THAT ITS CORRUPT DISEASE AND IGNORANT PRETENCE ARE FAIL TO SEE
8842-304647-0005 A PAPOLO INA BASIA
8842-304647-0006 THE PEOPLE IS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN BUT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HANDS OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND RAIN ONE KICK WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPEFIED BY BUG BEARS VAIN
8842-304647-0007 ST WONDERFUL
8842-304647-0008 THAT PENANCE HATH NO BLAME WHICH MAGDILIN FOUND SWEET PURGING OUR SHAME SELF PUNISHMENT IS VIRTUE ON MEN KNOW
8842-304647-0009 ORGAN OF ROUT NOT REASON IS THE LORD WHO FROM THE BODY POLITIC DOTH DRAIN LOST FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US LEAVE HIS CRICKETS ONDRY SWARD
8842-304647-0010 WELL TOO IF HE LIKE LOVE WOULD FEEL OUR HORDE WITH PLEASURE TO OURSELVESLUCING OUR VEIN AND VIGOUR TO PERPETUATE THE STRAIN OF A LIFE BY SPILT OF LIFE WITHIN A SWORD
8842-304647-0011 HEAVEN HELP THAT BODY WHICH A LITTLE MIND HOUSED IN AHEAD LACKING EARS TONGUE AND EYES IN SENSELESS BUT FOR SMELL CONTORINIZED
8842-304647-0012 DUE TO THEE THEIR PRAISE OF MAIDEN PURE OF TEMING MOTHERHOOD
