7850-111771-0008 WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSSE AND A FEW FRIENDS
7850-111771-0009 HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY ANDABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTED LABOUR WITHOUT FATIGUE
7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BURTOCKANS
7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT A MASK AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
7850-281318-0002 AND HERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
7850-281318-0003 OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A WHOLE
7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNEASY
7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER WORD
7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLATES WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
7850-281318-0007 AND SHE SAW ALL THE OTHER BIRDS HOPING ABOUT AND QUITTERING HELPLESSLY
7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK OR TO TEACH US
7850-281318-0009 SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPING TWITCHING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
7850-281318-0010 OH WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NICE AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A ANCIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH WOOD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST
7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
7850-281318-0014 AND SOME OF THE BIRD WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
7850-281318-0015 I HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
7850-281318-0016 CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACK AH
7850-281318-0017 HERE WOULD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLAY SO STICKS THROUGH END ACROSS CHRIST CROSS CRES CROSS SOW
7850-281318-0018 FRIS CROSS GRIS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON
7850-281318-0019 YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BUT YOURSELVES
7850-281318-0020 MUCH SHOCK MAY YOU HAVE
7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSINESS IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST SLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WORD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRIS CROSS AS THE MAGBY HAVE SHOWN HER
7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WILL BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
7850-286674-0001 IT IS DISGRACEABLE
7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGIN UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS A PIECE AND THREE GIANTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GLLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LOVER
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NIPH
7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MASTER
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THEIR SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTENED PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARMLIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS A JOINT AND HOLDS HIS SLIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
7850-286674-0012 SCARED DON WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES A SNAPPY DIRT OH
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACKS SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAPP AFTER HIS DINNER
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAWN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LAVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
7850-286674-0017 THE KYMPS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
7850-73752-0000 FORDINAN MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE
7850-73752-0001 IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUBURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE
7850-73752-0002 IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGUISE
7850-73752-0003 THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FORDINAND OUR MIND AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUSMEERBEL WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVERCOMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
7850-73752-0004 FERDINAN FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS
7850-73752-0005 IT WAS INDEED HER HEADWRITING
7850-73752-0006 RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANED OVER THE BALASRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY
7850-73752-0007 HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHE THE COD
7850-73752-0008 FOUR IN TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORDLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET
7850-73752-0009 THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN APPROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
7850-73752-0010 HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE PUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA
7850-73752-0011 HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW RECORDED
7850-73752-0012 AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO HIM
7850-73752-0013 IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON VOLCANO
7850-73752-0014 BUT NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY
7850-73752-0015 WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND GLOWING RIVER
7850-73752-0016 HE MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TELLISTMAN
7850-73752-0017 IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THE HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME
7850-73752-0018 IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WARE AND TERROR OF PLAY THE RECCRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVIN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR UNDER THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATTONIA
7850-73752-0019 THIS PAPA ALONE INQUIRED MISS TEMPLE
7976-105575-0000 GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FAULT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
7976-105575-0001 MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANTAGE
7976-105575-0002 OUR REGAIN WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED
7976-105575-0003 THERE WERE NO BREAST WORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIG GRAIN OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED THE ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT
7976-105575-0004 NOT BY THE CLAVER NOR THE ALMOR SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS THE DUEL TO THE DEATH
7976-105575-0005 NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOR YEARS WORE LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME
7976-105575-0006 ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOCKED DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY BE WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
7976-105575-0007 THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD
7976-105575-0008 WITH A FEW LANTERNS ARE MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING
7976-105575-0009 IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF WHO AS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT
7976-105575-0010 FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF A LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
7976-105575-0011 I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH THE COMRADE WHO SHED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JIMMIE KING
7976-105575-0012 HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION AT MISSISSIPPI
7976-105575-0013 WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GIVING THE WORST OF IT TOO
7976-105575-0014 THAT EVENING IN ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO INSULT THE ENEMIES LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT
7976-105575-0015 UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS REBLE ARMY
7976-105575-0016 ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISSUINGCO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHUT THROUGH THE BREAST
7976-105575-0017 I COULD NOT HELP MY FRIENDS
7976-105575-0018 GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILE ALL WILL BE NEEDED
7976-105575-0019 MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO BUY ELSEWHERE
7976-105575-0020 I FASTENED BACK TO THE LINES
7976-105575-0021 THE CLOUD ARE REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
7976-105575-0022 A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TO MOAT THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS
7976-105575-0023 THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DESIGNS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS
7976-105575-0024 THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLE FIELD AMONG THE UNBARY DEAD
7976-105575-0025 INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCEING GRANT IN THOSE DAYS
7976-105575-0026 ROSE RANCE PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN
7976-105575-0027 IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAY GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME
7976-105575-0028 FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD OF HATRY BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED
7976-105575-0029 A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HALLS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TWO WAS WAR
7976-110124-0000 LONG AGO THERE LIVE A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
7976-110124-0001 EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY WON ACCOUNT
7976-110124-0002 HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNEW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MAY COME UPON YOU
7976-110124-0003 WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BED INTO A NEAR BY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
7976-110124-0004 HAVE PITY UPON A POOR OR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT
7976-110124-0005 LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE KNIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF
7976-110124-0006 IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILS OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
7976-110124-0007 HE HAS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID
7976-110124-0008 IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR DIGGER IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT
7976-110124-0009 BUT WE SHOULD NOT GET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
7976-110124-0010 HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BAGOR
7976-110124-0011 IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BIGR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING
7976-110124-0012 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BIGER HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM
7976-110124-0013 THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT MIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY
7976-110124-0014 SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING ENCOUNTER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK
7976-110124-0015 THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UN BOTH THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE DOOR
7976-110124-0016 IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBERS CHIEFTAIN
7976-110124-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN OUTWI HER YET CRIED ANOTHER
7976-110124-0018 THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT FROM CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
7976-110124-0019 I'D PROMISED YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM
7976-110124-0020 YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO BY FATHER'S HOUSE
7976-110124-0021 PASSED THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER
7976-110124-0022 WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HALL AND DOOR
7976-110124-0023 THE CRIES AND CURSSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR
7976-110124-0024 THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREEK DOORS
7976-110124-0025 ALL MY WORR IS ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH
7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BRAVE OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
7976-110523-0001 HOW CAN SHE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAY THE COFFINS FOR US
7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE WHILE HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
7976-110523-0004 AND AS SOON AS THE PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID COUNSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BY
7976-110523-0006 BUT IN REALITY ALSO WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELL HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A PLACE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEAR WOULD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN YOU ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
7976-110523-0010 HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE REDCOAT BROKE A LARGE ROUND PAIN OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO A COTTAGE
7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAY LATE CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK UP HASEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
7976-110523-0014 CRISTEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
7976-110523-0015 GRUDHLE SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANDSOME FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
7976-110523-0016 DARE GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED
7976-110523-0017 CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GUTIA GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANDSOME
7976-110523-0018 SEEING I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF
7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE ALVEN
7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WIDOW'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
7976-110523-0021 THEN THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
8297-275154-0000 NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENEDICT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME ROLLIN THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SIDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
8297-275154-0001 THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CREWASE WAS OVER
8297-275154-0002 THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RAMLE
8297-275154-0003 GRANDAL WAITED WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENEDET MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT
8297-275154-0004 HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SIGHTINUM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM
8297-275154-0005 THAT HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM
8297-275154-0006 RANDALL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
8297-275154-0007 AFTER MOMENTS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT
8297-275154-0008 YOU DISTRESSED ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
8297-275154-0009 HE DRANK THE HOUARN GREEDILY
8297-275154-0010 WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREADING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
8297-275154-0011 HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKEN NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
8297-275154-0012 RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SIDNEY IS
8297-275154-0013 I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHERS
8297-275154-0014 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I HAVE LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
8297-275154-0015 I'M ALONE DO YE HEAR THAT ALONE
8297-275154-0016 I HAVE ENGAGED ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
8297-275154-0017 WHO WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS
8297-275154-0018 I M AFRAID HE SAID
8297-275154-0019 I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELINGS THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW
8297-275154-0020 HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS WHISPERED HEAD
8297-275154-0021 WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THAT
8297-275154-0022 I CAN'T DO IT
8297-275154-0023 LET ME HEAR THAT IT IS FIRST
8297-275154-0024 I FEEL FOR YOU HARVARD HE SAID WARMLY

8297-275154-0026 LET ME REST A LITTLE HE COMPLETEED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
8297-275154-0027 HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVON WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDLE AFTER THE BREAK UP OF THE FAMILY
8297-275155-0000 ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SIGNUM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER

8297-275155-0002 AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COMS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE
8297-275155-0003 GRAHAM LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH
8297-275155-0004 WITH HIS OWN SUSPICION SUDDENLY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER
8297-275155-0005 MISSUS NORMEN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER
8297-275155-0006 MISSUS PRESBY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL

8297-275155-0016 HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORAMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM
8297-275155-0017 WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT ALTOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
8297-275155-0018 AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KETTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW

8297-275155-0029 IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDALL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENEDET TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND
8297-275155-0030 GOOD BYE DEAR RANDAL
8297-275155-0031 ARRIVED AT THE STATION GRANDDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
8297-275155-0032 WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SIDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN
8297-275156-0000 WHAT HAVE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED
8297-275156-0001 YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE
8297-275156-0002 WE HAVE BOTH SEEMED THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
8297-275156-0003 NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND ONCE MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE CREDIT CAN SUPPLY
8297-275156-0004 SUPPOSING THE SUPPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
8297-275156-0005 IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESDY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
8297-275156-0006 HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SIDNEY AT INTERVIEW
8297-275156-0007 EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENY DECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SIDE THEM
8297-275156-0008 BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
8297-275156-0009 CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THE LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND
8297-275156-0010 WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED VANDALS PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THEN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE
8297-275156-0011 SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FOR ME WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW
8297-275156-0012 HE ADDED SIGNNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
8297-275156-0013 BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXPOSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY
84-121123-0000 GROW DO YOU HEAR
84-121123-0001 BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY RATE
84-121123-0002 AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOOD SHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPIMPLEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY
84-121123-0003 AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS HORRORS IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE
84-121123-0004 DAVIN HE RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE
84-121123-0005 DAVINY UNABLE TO BARE THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN
84-121123-0006 FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND BARS
84-121123-0007 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SO
84-121123-0008 OH YOU WAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE
84-121123-0009 DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORRREL
84-121123-0010 NOIER LOOKED UPON MARILLA WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VOLUNTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
84-121123-0011 SAID MARILLA SADLY YES REPLIED NOTIER
84-121123-0012 THE OLD MAN'S EYES MADE FIXED ON THE DOOR
84-121123-0013 ASKED BERYL YES
84-121123-0014 MUST I HAVE ALONE NO
84-121123-0015 BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU GUESS
84-121123-0016 GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOUR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOR EVER REMAINED BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK
84-121123-0017 MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRITS NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER
84-121123-0018 MORLAND SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM
84-121123-0019 THE OLD MAN MADE A DESIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
84-121123-0020 IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF ROTIERE WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS
84-121123-0021 BUT HE STOPPED OF THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER
84-121123-0022 THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONG
84-121123-0023 NOIRTA WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE
84-121123-0024 THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOOSED TO THE LIPS
84-121123-0025 THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ENVOY WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS
84-121123-0026 D'ARTAGNAN SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I TO SEE YOU AS TO COMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM
84-121123-0027 I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME WERE YOU NOT
84-121123-0028 I AM GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PAIRS WILL BE MORE FERVENT THAN MINE
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHMES
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTHMOST LIMITED ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PRECEDEAH THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERESHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
84-121550-0004 YE OUR KNEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE HER ADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELING BUT THE SONG DELICTOSSY GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUND YOUR INTELLECT
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOUL IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANDSOME OF ETERNAL PIECE
84-121550-0007 BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SURJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND A TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLEPT SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FAITHD
84-121550-0010 NOT EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
84-121550-0011 NOW HA LECOQ MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR EURONIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT INVERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
84-121550-0012 THEN REBECCA TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCE BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DEALIES GIRDLE
84-121550-0014 THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WORSE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WHERE THE OUTERMOST APART
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHANT ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR ERE GLADDENED AFRICANOUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FRESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN DATE EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS ENTERTAINED
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VAINY SPONS OF DELY BONO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH E'RE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
84-121550-0023 TO THE LEFT HAND I TURN WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
84-121550-0024 TO SAY AND TO VER JULIUS NOT A DRAW HOME OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
84-121550-0025 THENARDIER BECAUSE WHERE JULIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET A WHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEEDST MUST WEEP
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO E'ERWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
84-121550-0027 LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH IRON BEATRICE
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NEITHER NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGE IS MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOOR BE OF ONE MEASURE
84-121550-0030 BUT BY THE LARGEST OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR GRAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND DATE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELT THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PREDITION
84-121550-0033 CONFUSION AND DISMAY TO GATHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
84-121550-0034 WHENCE SAID TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALARMMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHER SHEWED THAT THOU SHOULD TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
8842-302196-0000 HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF PALMS BY THE ITALIANS CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE A VERSION OF THE WHOLE VITINOVA PROSE AND VERSE
8842-302196-0001 THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOUR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF ROSETIE TO RANK AS A POETIC TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT
8842-302196-0002 THE LIFE FLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THIS COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD PAUL SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE
8842-302196-0003 THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FOR PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRENCH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW OF FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY
8842-302196-0004 POETRY NOT BEING AN EXACT SCIENCE LITERALITY OF RENDERING IS ALTOGETHER SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW
8842-302196-0005 OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIUM EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME KATE AND SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHORS STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF AS DANZA MUST BE WEAKENED TO ADOPT SOME RHME WHICH WILL TELL HE AND HE SEES THE POET REVELING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SCANTLY SUPPLIED
8842-302196-0006 AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYCIES OF THE PALM WHICH I OMITTED
8842-302196-0007 ON JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH HE WROTE MANY A MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THOROUGHLY PERFORMED
8842-302196-0008 MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE OF REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE PALTRY AND USELESS
8842-302196-0009 IT IS THEREFORE AND UPON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF
8842-302196-0010 THROUGHOUT THE BEATEN WALLVA THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA
8842-302196-0011 A WORD SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DANTAS AOBIOGRAPHY
8842-302196-0012 THIS HAS INDUCED SOME EDITORS OF THE VATANOVA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE
8842-302201-0000 THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN AVERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
8842-302201-0001 WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERS TIMES OF MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
8842-302201-0002 BUT WHEN I STILL SPEAK NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT AND LOVEDST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
8842-302201-0003 AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL ME BE ATTITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME
8842-302201-0004 THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOWFALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THERE TALK MINGLED WITH SIZE
8842-302201-0005 AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHOULD SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO WHOM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGNED
8842-302201-0006 WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE TO ISSUE THEM IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HARD STEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE
8842-302201-0007 TO HER I WENT LONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS HAS MADE STRONG
8842-302201-0008 SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVED
8842-302201-0009 THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE THEIR SONG I KNOW
8842-302201-0010 THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO BEFORE
8842-302201-0011 IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINT HARDNESS
8842-302201-0012 IN THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM
8842-302201-0013 IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY HAS DESIRED
8842-302201-0014 THE SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER IS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELIEVING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL AND THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRIADING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVESATH CONCERNING HER
8842-302201-0015 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO ONE FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE
8842-302203-0000 AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSEEN WHICH CAUGHT OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD
8842-302203-0001 AND SO STRONG WAS MY FANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE OH EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESS IT IS HE THAT NOW LOOK AT THE POND THEE
8842-302203-0002 WHERE BY OTHER LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOAN THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS THAT MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEN SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SAYING SLEEP NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED
8842-302203-0003 WHEN BEING AROUSED I OPENED THIN EYES AND KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPTION
8842-302203-0004 IN MY HUE WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY OR LET US COMFORT HIM THEN UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT HATH SHAKEN THE SO MUCH
8842-302203-0005 AND THERE WITH ALL SUCH A BEWILDERMENT POSSESSED ME THAT I SHUT MY EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASE ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY HELPFUL THING
8842-302203-0006 THEN SAW I MANY BROKEN HINTED SIGHTS AND A UNCERTAIN STATE I STEPPED INTO
8842-302203-0007 THESE WILDERNESSING FANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DUD
8842-302203-0008 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE I WAS THE THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TWO
8842-302203-0009 THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JOAN BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS CALLED OF MANY BUT A MAVAEA SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM
8842-302203-0010 AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN I CHANCED TO LOOK THE WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JONE AND BEATRICE REPROACH ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND MARBLE INSTANTLY
8842-302203-0011 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HEAR SAYING BE NOW THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE
8842-304647-0000 HE LIVES THY LOSS HE DIES FROM EVERY LIMB MANDLED BY THEE LIGHTNINGS OF GOD HAD SHINE FROM WHICH THY DARKNESS HATH NOT WHERE TO HIDE
8842-304647-0001 QUEEN SHE IMPER'D US TO BEAUTY
8842-304647-0002 AND FLESH WAS RAIMENTED HOW HE WAS KILLED AND BURIED FROM THE DEAD HOW HE AROSE TO LIFE WITH VICTORY AND REIGNED IN HEAVEN HOW ALL OF US SHALL BE GLORIOUS LIKE HIM WHOSE HEARTS TO HIS ARE WED HOW THEY WHO DIE FOR LOVE OF REASON GIVE HYPOCRITES TYRANTS SOPHISTS ALL WHO SELL THEIR NEIGHBOURS ILL FOR HOLINESS TO HELL HOW THE DEADS SAINT CONDEMNS THE BAD WHO LIVE AS TO HELL HOW HELL HOW HE DOES BECOMES A LAW FOR HELLINESS TO HELL HOW HELL HOW THE JUDGE SHALL COME AGAIN
8842-304647-0003 THIS WORLD'S THICK VAPOURS WILLM YOUR EYES UNWORTHY OF THAT GLORIOUS SHOW BLIND HIS SPLENDOUR BENT UPON HIS SHAME
8842-304647-0004 MONEY IS FALSE AND LIGHT UNLESS IT BE BOUGHT BY A MAN'S OWN WORTHY QUALITIES IN BLOOD IS SUCH THAT ITS CORRUPT DISEASE AND IGNORANT PRETENCE ARE FALSE TO SEE
8842-304647-0005 A PAPOLO IN A BASSIA
8842-304647-0006 THE PEOPLE IS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HANDS OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND RAIN ONE KICK WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPEFIED BY BUGAR'S VEIN
8842-304647-0007 MOST FEARFUL
8842-304647-0008 THAT PENANCE HATH NO BLAME WHICH MADILIN FOUND SWEET PURGING OUR SHAME SELF PUNISHMENT IS VIRTUE ALL MEN KNOW
8842-304647-0009 ORGAN OF ROUT NOT REASON IS THE LORD WHO FROM THE BODY POLITIC DOTH DRAIN LOST FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US LEAVE HIS CRICKETS UND DRY SWARD
8842-304647-0010 WELL TOO IF HE LIKE LOVE WOULD FEEL OUR HORDE WITH PLEASURE TO OURSELVES LOOSEING OUR VEIN AND VIGOR TO PERPETUATE THE STRAIN OF A LIFE BY SPILF OF LIFE WITHIN A SWORD
8842-304647-0011 HEAVEN HELP THAT BODY WHICH A LITTLE MIND HOUSED IN A HEAD LACKING EARS TONGUE AND EYES IN SENSELESS BUT FOR SMELL CONTORANDISE
8842-304647-0012 DUE TO THEE THERE PRAISE OF MAIDEN PURE OF TEEMING MOTHERHOOD
8842-304647-0013 THOU LIKE ARCHERS STEADFAST IN THE SKIES WITH TARDY SENSE GUIDED BY KINGDOM FAIR BEARING ALONE THE LOAD OF LIBERTY
