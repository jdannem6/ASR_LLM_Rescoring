7850-111771-0008 WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SOME JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS
7850-111771-0009 HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY AND ABILITY TO REFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTED LABOUR WITHOUT FATIGUE
7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BURTICANS
7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT A LAST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
7850-281318-0002 AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I WILL TELL YOU
7850-281318-0003 AH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS WUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BOY
7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO A NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
7850-281318-0007 AND SHE SAW ALL THE OTHER BIRDS HOPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY
7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASKER TO TEACH US
7850-281318-0009 SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPING TWINTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
7850-281318-0010 O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT GLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH WORD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST
7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER IN NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
7850-281318-0014 AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CHEERFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
7850-281318-0015 I'D THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
7850-281318-0016 CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACK DOG
7850-281318-0017 HERE WOULD PIGEON SAID MOTHER BAGPIE YOU MUST PLAY SO STICKS THROUGH END ACROSS CHRIST CROSS CHRIST CROSS SOW
7850-281318-0018 CRIS CROSS GRIS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON
7850-281318-0019 YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY OURSELVES
7850-281318-0020 MUCH LOCK MAY YOU HAVE
7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSINESS IN THE ALM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WOULD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRIS CROSS AS THE MAID BY HAD SHOWN HER
7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBOURS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
7850-286674-0001 IT IS GRACEFUL
7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO SPRINGING UP AT ALL
7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE THREE MEALS
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GELLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED THE HARVEY
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NIMPH
7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR FORWARD LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTENED PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINSERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS SLIPP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
7850-286674-0012 SCARED DIE WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES A SNAPPY DIRT OLD
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHOUTING IN THE SUNLIGHT
7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCH THE MUD THE LAST LAVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
7850-73752-0000 FERDINAN MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE
7850-73752-0001 IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUNBURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE
7850-73752-0002 IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGEROUS AND DISGRACE
7850-73752-0003 THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FORDINAND OUR MINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MERE BELL WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVERCOMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
7850-73752-0004 FERDIN FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS
7850-73752-0005 IT WAS INDEED HER HANDWRIATING
7850-73752-0006 RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANED OVER THE BALASTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY
7850-73752-0007 HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHOOSE THE COD
7850-73752-0008 FOR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORDLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET
7850-73752-0009 THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
7850-73752-0010 HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH VERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA
7850-73752-0011 HIS CONSTANTY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED
7850-73752-0012 AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FEATURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM
7850-73752-0013 IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON THE VOLCANO
7850-73752-0014 AND NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPY
7850-73752-0015 WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER
7850-73752-0016 HE MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TALLESTMAN
7850-73752-0017 IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FORDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME
7850-73752-0018 IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WARE AND TERROR OF PLAY THE RECCRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVIN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR UNDER THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANTONIA
7850-73752-0019 IS PAPA ALONE INQUIRED MISSUS TEMPLE
7976-105575-0000 GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH THE COMMANDER AND CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FAULT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
7976-105575-0001 MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCED
7976-105575-0002 OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBED
7976-105575-0003 THERE WERE NO BREAST WORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIG GRAIN OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED THE SALT AFTER ASSAULT
7976-105575-0004 NOT BY THE CLAVA NOR THE ALMA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS THE DUEL TO THE DEATH
7976-105575-0005 NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME
7976-105575-0006 ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY BE WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
7976-105575-0007 THAT MIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD
7976-105575-0008 WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TO MORNING
7976-105575-0009 IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF WHO IS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT
7976-105575-0010 FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEADER WOUNDED
7976-105575-0011 I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH THE COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JIMMIE KING
7976-105575-0012 HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION IN MISS MISSISSIPPI
7976-105575-0013 WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GET IN THE WORST OF IT TOO
7976-105575-0014 THAT EVENING AND ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMIES LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT
7976-105575-0015 UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAID THE VICTORIOUS REBEL ARMY
7976-105575-0016 ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISSUING GO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHUT THROUGH THE BREAST
7976-105575-0017 I COULD NOT HELD MY FRIEND
7976-105575-0018 GO BACK TO THE REMNANT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE NEEDED
7976-105575-0019 MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OFF TO DIE ELSEWHERE
7976-105575-0020 I HASTEN BACK TO THE LINES
7976-105575-0021 THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEMED DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
7976-105575-0022 A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOAT THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS
7976-105575-0023 THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THEIR WORKS
7976-105575-0024 THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLE FIELD AMONG THE UNBEARY DEAD
7976-105575-0025 INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN RENT IN THOSE DAYS
7976-105575-0026 ROSE CRAMPS PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN
7976-105575-0027 IT REQUIRED MONTH AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME
7976-105575-0028 FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD OF HATCHI BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED
7976-105575-0029 A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOLES WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TWO WAS WAR
7976-110124-0000 LONG AGO THEIR LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
7976-110124-0001 EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON ACCOUNT
7976-110124-0002 HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MAY COME UPON YOU
7976-110124-0003 WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEARBY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
7976-110124-0004 HAVE PITI UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT

7976-110124-0006 IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORNS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
7976-110124-0007 HE IS ALL AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID
7976-110124-0008 IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGER IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT
7976-110124-0009 BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGIVE OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
7976-110124-0010 HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BAKER
7976-110124-0011 IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BIGGER SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING
7976-110124-0012 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BIGR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM
7976-110124-0013 THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE WAY
7976-110124-0014 SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING PATTERN HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK
7976-110124-0015 THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UN BOTH THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE
7976-110124-0016 IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBERT CHIEFTAIN
7976-110124-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER
7976-110124-0018 THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
7976-110124-0019 I PROMISED YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM

7976-110124-0022 WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE WHOLE END DOOR
7976-110124-0023 THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILL THE AIR
7976-110124-0024 THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BRIGHT DOWN THE GREAT DOORS
7976-110124-0025 ALL MY WORIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH
7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL COME OF US

7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN YOU MUST ALL FOR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAY THE COFFINS FOR US
7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PIECE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN

7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID ANSWER I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BY
7976-110523-0006 BUT IN REALITY ANSWER WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CROSST WITH THE CHILDREN
7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEP MOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEAR WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN YOU ARE READY WE WILL COME IN FETCH YOU AGAIN
7976-110523-0010 HANDSOME THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE RUGGLES BROKE A LARGE ROUND PAIN OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SANG SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE
7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WIT WHO WAY LAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK UP HANDSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
7976-110523-0014 REHNHJELM BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED

7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE EVEN
7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCHE'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
7976-110523-0021 THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S DECK
8297-275154-0000 NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENEDICT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME GWENDOLEN THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SIDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
8297-275154-0001 THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CREWS WAS OVER

8297-275155-0029 IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARDS BENEDET TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND
8297-275155-0030 GOOD BYE DEAR RANDLE
8297-275155-0031 ARRIVED AT THE STATION VANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
8297-275155-0032 WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SIDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN
8297-275156-0000 WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE HE ASKED
8297-275156-0001 YOU HAD BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE
8297-275156-0002 WE HAVE BOTH SEEING THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
8297-275156-0003 NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIPING PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND ONCE MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY
8297-275156-0004 SUPPOSEING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
8297-275156-0005 IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTI HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
8297-275156-0006 HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SIDNEY AN INTERVIEW
8297-275156-0007 EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENYCK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE GRANDAL'S VISIT TO SIDE THEM
8297-275156-0008 BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RATTLE COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
8297-275156-0009 CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEM TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND
8297-275156-0010 WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDALLS PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THEN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE
8297-275156-0011 SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FOR YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW
8297-275156-0012 HE ADDED SIGNNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
8297-275156-0013 BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSEIBLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY
84-121123-0000 COME DO YOU HEAR
84-121123-0001 BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WAIT
84-121123-0002 AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTERED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOOD SHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY
84-121123-0003 AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS POORERS IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE
84-121123-0004 D'ARTAGNAN RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE
84-121123-0005 DAVINY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF HIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN
84-121123-0006 FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND BEARS
84-121123-0007 WHAT DO YOU MEANS SIR
84-121123-0008 OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE
84-121123-0009 DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORRELE
84-121123-0010 NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORAL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VOLUNTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
84-121123-0011 SAID MORAL SADLY YES REPLIED NATIER
84-121123-0012 THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIX ON THE DOOR
84-121123-0013 AS ROYAL YES
84-121123-0014 MUST I LIVE ALONE NO
84-121123-0015 BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU HE YES
84-121123-0016 GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOUR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOR EVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK
84-121123-0017 MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER
84-121123-0018 MOREOVER SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM
84-121123-0019 THE OLD MAN MADE ASIDE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
84-121123-0020 IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF ROTIERE WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED ON HIS CHEEKS
84-121123-0021 BUT HE STOPPED IN THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER
84-121123-0022 THE TWO DAUGHTERS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE
84-121123-0023 MOIRTIER WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE
84-121123-0024 THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOZED TO THE LIPS
84-121123-0025 THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ALI WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS
84-121123-0026 D'VINY SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I WILL SEE YOU AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM
84-121123-0027 I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE YOU WILL ACCUSE ME WILL YOU NOT
84-121123-0028 I AM GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FERVANT THAN MINE
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED DAY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMIT ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PRECEDENA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT ALIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
84-121550-0004 YE ARE KNEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE HER ADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELING BUT THE SONG DELICTOSSY GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOAD YOUR INTELLECT
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOUL IN ITSELF DIVIDING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANDSOME OF ETERNAL PEACE
84-121550-0007 BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SURJURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAVE SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MIND WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
84-121550-0010 NOR EVEN THUS HER WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
84-121550-0011 NOW HALEKIN MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR EURONIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT INVERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
84-121550-0012 THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCE BY NEW WEDED BRIDES
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLORS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DEALIOUS GIRDLE
84-121550-0014 THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WORTH THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WHERE THE OUTERMOST APART
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR OR GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY READ THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLUSH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE ENGAGEMENT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INDICATED
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VAINLY SPONCE A DELY BONO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FOR MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
84-121550-0023 TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE HAS AFFLICTED
84-121550-0024 TO SAY UNTO VER JULIUS NOT A DROP HOME OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
84-121550-0025 THENARDIER BECAUSE FOR JULIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET A WHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEEDST MUST WEEP
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
84-121550-0027 LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE THIN AND DULL BE OF ONE MEASURE
84-121550-0030 BUT BY THE LARGEST OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND DAY I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELT THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION
84-121550-0033 CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A GUESS FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
84-121550-0034 WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MIND WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALARMMENTS OR WHAT ADVANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHER SHEWED THAT THOU SHOULD TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
8842-302196-0000 HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF PALMS BY THE ITALIANS CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE AVERSION OF THE WHOLE VITINOVA PROSE AND VERSE
8842-302196-0001 THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF ROSETIE TO RANK AS A POETIC TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT
8842-302196-0002 THE LIFE FLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THIS COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD HOME SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE
8842-302196-0003 THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FOR PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRESH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW A FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY
8842-302196-0004 POETRY NOT BEING IN EXACT SCIENCE LITERALITY OF RENDERING IS ALTOGETHER SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW
8842-302196-0005 OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIUM EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CATENT SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHORS STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF AS DANZA MUST BE WEAKENED TO ADOPT SOME RHME WHICH WILL TELL HE AND HE SEES THE POET REVELING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SCANTLY SUPPLIED
8842-302196-0006 AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYSIES OF THE PALM WHICH I EMITTED
8842-302196-0007 ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH HE WROTE MANY OF MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THOROUGHLY PERFORMED
8842-302196-0008 MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE PALTRY IN USELESS
8842-302196-0009 IT IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS NECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF
8842-302196-0010 THROUGHOUT THE EATEN WATER THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA
8842-302196-0011 A WORD SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DANTISE AUTOBIOGRAPHY
8842-302196-0012 THIS HAS INDUCED SOME EDITORS OF THE VITONOVA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE
8842-302201-0000 THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED AND ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN AVERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
8842-302201-0001 WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERSE TIMES IN MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
8842-302201-0002 BUT WHEN I STILL SPEAK NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT AND LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
8842-302201-0003 AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BE ATTITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME
8842-302201-0004 THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THERE TALK MINGLED WITH SIZE
8842-302201-0005 AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHOULD SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAIL NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGNED
8842-302201-0006 WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE TO ISSUE THENCE AND FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART STEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE
8842-302201-0007 TO HER I WENT ALONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG
8842-302201-0008 SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND A LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE
8842-302201-0009 THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AND ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SONG I KNOW
8842-302201-0010 THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO WAR
8842-302201-0011 IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPED BY FAINT HEARTEDNESS
8842-302201-0012 AND THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM MY PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM
8842-302201-0013 IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HEAR MY LADY IS DESIRED
8842-302201-0014 THE SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER IS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELIEVING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL AND THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVESAETH CONCERNING HER
8842-302201-0015 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE AND THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE
8842-302203-0000 AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSEN WHICH CAUGHT OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD
8842-302203-0001 AND SO STRONG WAS MY FANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE OH EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESS IT IS HE THAT NOW LOOK AT UPON THEE
8842-302203-0002 WHERE BY OTHER LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOAN THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS OF MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEN SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SAYING SLEEPING NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED
8842-302203-0003 WHEN BEING AROUSED I OPENED MY EYES AND KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPTION
8842-302203-0004 AND MY HUE WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY OR LET US COMFORT HIM THEN UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT HATH SHAKEN THEE SO MUCH
8842-302203-0005 AND THERE WITH ALL SUCH A BEWILDERMENT POSSESSED ME THAT I SHUT MINE EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASE ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY HEALTHFUL THING
8842-302203-0006 THEN SAW I MANY BROKEN HINTED SIGHTS IN THE UNCERTAIN STATE I STEPPED INTO
8842-302203-0007 THESE BEWILDERING FANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DEAD
8842-302203-0008 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE I WAS A THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TOO
8842-302203-0009 THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JOAN BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS CALLED OF MANY BUT HE MAVAEA SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM
8842-302203-0010 AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN I CHANCED TO LOOK THE WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JONE AND BEATRICE APPROACH ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND MARBLE INSTANTLY
8842-302203-0011 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE SAY BE NOW THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE
8842-304647-0000 HE LIVES THY LOSS HE DIES FROM EVERY LIMB MANLED BY THEE LIGHTNINGS OF GOD HAD SHINE FROM WHICH THY DARKNESS HATH NOT WHERE TO HIDE
8842-304647-0001 QUEEN SHE IMPAIRED US TO BEAUTY
8842-304647-0002 AND FLESH WAS RAIMENTED HOW HE WAS KILLED AND BURIED FROM THE DEAD HOW HE AROSE TO LIFE WITH VICTORY AND REIGNED IN HEAVEN HOW ALL OF US SHALL BE GLORIOUS LIKE HIM WHOSE HEARTS TO HIS ARE WED HOW THEY WHO DIE FOR LOVE OF REASON GIVE HYPOCRITES TYRANTS SOPHISTS ALL WHO SELL THEIR NEIGHBOURS ILL FOR HOLINESS TO HELL HOW THE DEADS SAINT CONDEMNS THE BAD WHO LIVE AS TO HELL HOW HELL HOW HE DOES BECOMES A LAW FOR HELLINESS TO HELL HOW HELL HOW HE AT LAST TO JUDGE SHALL COME AGAIN
8842-304647-0003 THIS WORLD'S THICK VAPOURS WELLM YOUR EYES UNWORTHY OF THAT GLORIOUS SHOW BLIND HIS SPLENDOUR BENT UPON HIS SHAME
8842-304647-0004 MONEY IS FALSE AND LIGHT UNLESS IT BE BOUGHT BY A MAN'S OWN WORTHY QUALITIES IN BLOOD IS SUCH THAT ITS CORRUPT DISEASE AND IGNORANT PRETENCE ARE FAR TO SEE
8842-304647-0005 A PALPOLO IN A BASIA
8842-304647-0006 THE PEOPLE IS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN BUT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HANDS OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND RAIN ONE KICK WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPEFIED BY BUG BEARS VEIN
8842-304647-0007 MOST BEAUTIFUL
8842-304647-0008 THAT PENANCE HATH NO BLAME WHICH MANTILIN FOUND SWEET PURGING OUR SHAME SELF PUNISHMENT IS VIRTUE WHILE MEN KNOW
8842-304647-0009 ORGAN OF ROUT NOT REASON IS THE LORD WHO FROM THE BODY POLITIC DOTH DREAM LOST FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US LEAVE HIS CRICKETS ONDRIE SWARD
8842-304647-0010 WELL TOO IF HE LIKE LOVE WOULD FEEL OUR HORDE WITH PLEASURE TO OURSELVES LOOSEING OUR VEIN AND VIGOUR TO PERPETUATE THE STRAIN OF A LIFE BY SPILF OF LIFE WITHIN A SWORD
8842-304647-0011 HEAVEN HELP THAT BODY WHICH A LITTLE MIND HOUSED IN A HEAD LACKING EARS TONGUE AND EYES IN SENSELESS BUT FOR SMELL CONTORINISE
8842-304647-0012 DO TO THEE THEIR PRAISE OF MAIDEN PURE OF TEEMING MOTHERHOOD
8842-304647-0013 THOU LIKE ARTERUS STEADFAST IN THE SKIES WITH TARDY SENSE GUIDED BY KINGDOM FAIR BEARING ALONE THE LOAD OF LIBERTY
