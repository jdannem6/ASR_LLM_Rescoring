2803-161169-0011 WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING FOOT TO THIS DAY
2803-161169-0012 THESE FOREST WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WEBBED NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS HOUSE AND MODELS AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE
2803-161169-0013 THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME HEDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND
2803-161169-0014 BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SET TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MAY THE GASP FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANYTHING FOR HARM ONLY
2803-161169-0015 IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GASMAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND KNOW THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
2803-161169-0016 DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSED COLDARD
2803-161169-0017 WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLISTER N TO HEAL THEM
2902-9006-0000 ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN EUREA LABOURS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE
2902-9006-0001 IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HAPPINESS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THEY SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN ABOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE
2902-9006-0002 NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF A SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES
2902-9006-0003 THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS THE LIGHT WHO LIGHTETH EVERY MAN WHICH COMETH INTO THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED AND THE HEART OF MANKIND A MORAL CRAVING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOLATED PHILOSOPHERS OR PROFITS
2902-9006-0004 THE VERY EMPERORS HAD TORED THEMSELVES ON HER SIDE
2902-9006-0005 JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAINED TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT AND WERE AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO RECALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS
2902-9006-0006 BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD COME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT
2902-9006-0007 IN THE MEANWHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT A DRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WATERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPORARATE OF EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOL FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HEREASIES AND THEOCPHS IT IS A DISGRACE TO THEOCIFY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES HIS BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR FANTASLES
2902-9006-0008 THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCH MEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOREVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFYER OF THE HUMAN SOUL
2902-9006-0009 BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE FREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS
2902-9006-0010 THE MEN'S SONNA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANNOM TO INHABIT
2902-9006-0011 AND THE NEW BLOOD AT THE ERE OF HIS STORY WAS AT HAND
2902-9006-0012 TRIED AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING DOWN TO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE
2902-9006-0013 THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOW LANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND A ROMAN WEAKNESS A CAUTIOUS BELLY WAS SOON FOUND
2902-9006-0014 HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE BENT UP DAYLOGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH A DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES
2902-9006-0015 THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPPING HAD ACCUMULATED AROUND THE CAPITAL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEP SKINS AND HORSEHIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW JALS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE THEN BLUELY DERIVEDALS ALONG THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COASTLAND NORTHERN AFRICA
2902-9006-0016 THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVIUM AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERORS WORKED IN NORTH AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE
2902-9006-0017 CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVE HOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHTIC GRACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE
2902-9006-0018 THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT IT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMO OSIUS MIGHT HANG AND HOMO IOSSIUS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO WHICH IT OWED AN ANCIENT STRONG HOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EF FEET REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE
2902-9006-0019 TWO SANESIUS'S MOST CHARMING LETTERS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF HISIDOR THE GOOD HABIT OF PELLUSIUM I BEG LEAVE TO REFER THOSE READERS WHO WISH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE FIFTH CENTURY
2902-9006-0020 I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHCONISMS AND ERRORS
2902-9008-0000 THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREAT THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN TOLD ME PHILADELPHUS WALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRATICS CALAMATCUS AND LIKE AFFRON
2902-9008-0001 THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFT BED A TABLE AND AN ARM CHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VOSES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE
2902-9008-0002 BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDE WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT CLASS
2902-9008-0003 SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF FOR MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER RIPE CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG HER OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN
2902-9008-0004 IF THEY HAVE CEASED TO GUIDE NATIONS THEY HAVE NOT CEASED TO SPEAK TO THEIR OWN SELECT
2902-9008-0005 IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE VULGAR HERD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF A PATIA
2902-9008-0006 TO BE WELCOMED INTO THE CELESTIAL RANKS OF THE HEROIC TO RISE TO THE UNIVERSAL GODS TO THE INEFFABLE POWERS ONWARD UP WHATEVER THROUGH AGES AND THREE ETERNITIES TILL I FIND MY HOME AT LAST AND VANISH IN THE GLORY OF THE NAMELESS AND THE ABSOLUTE ONE
2902-9008-0007 I TO BELIEVE AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF POOR FREE HIMSELF TO AN EVIL IS AND MAGIC
2902-9008-0008 HARD DO I CARE FOR FOOD
2902-9008-0009 HOW CAN HE WHO SPHERE LIES ABOVE THE STARS STOOP EVERY MOMENT TO EARTH
2902-9008-0010 Y SHE ANSWERED HALF BITTERLY AND WOULD THAT WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT FOOD AND IMITATE PERFECTLY THE IMMORTAL GODS
2902-9008-0011 THERE IS FRUIT WITH LENTILLS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BREAD UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT TOO MUCH
2902-9008-0012 STRANGE THAT NONE SHOULD BE CONTENT TO GROVEL AND BE MEN WHEN THEY MIGHT RISE TO THE RANK OF GODS
2902-9008-0013 NOT THAT SUCH A CREATURE AS THAT DISTURBS ME NO CREATED THING I HOPE CAN MOVE MY ECONNIMITY BUT IF I COULD STOOP TO HATE I SHOULD HATE HER HATE HER
2902-9008-0014 AND HER VOICE TOOK A TONE WHICH MADE IT SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN WEATHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE LOFTY IMPASSIBILITY WHICH SHE FELT BOUND TO POSSESS SHE DID NOT HATE PALAYIA WITH THE MOST HUMAN AND MUNDANE HATRED
2902-9008-0015 HIS EXCELLENCY MADAM THE PERFECT
2902-9008-0016 AND WHY SHOULD GOD DISTURB ME LET HIM ENTER
3000-15664-0000 SHASTA RAMBLES AND MODOX MEMORIES
3000-15664-0001 ARCTIC BEAUTY IN DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ONLY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUSLAMOURS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS
3000-15664-0002 PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERYONE SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF
3000-15664-0003 GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BETHOUGH YOU
3000-15664-0004 BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO OF FOOT
3000-15664-0005 ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGON THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT
3000-15664-0006 ONLY LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED
3000-15664-0007 THUS ONE SAUNTORS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME
3000-15664-0008 YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMONICATIVE SENDING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME
3000-15664-0009 AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WAS TAKING REST
3000-15664-0010 EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND THE CURRANTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET IN WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE AS STIR
3000-15664-0011 SLIGHT RAIN STORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF
3000-15664-0012 THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FREGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRDS SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL
3000-15664-0013 A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINALLY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKES A DEEPER SILENCE
3000-15664-0014 IN SETTING OUT FROM STRATBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTH WESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MAY SEE
3000-15664-0015 IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WHATFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE DOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE
3000-15664-0016 IT IS LINED WITH EMBLED ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH WILDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING
3000-15664-0017 IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MOARINE SPRINKLED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH
3000-15664-0018 THE LONG GRAY SLOPES LEADDING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEMED REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN
3000-15664-0019 MOST OF THE DRANGAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POOREST ROCKS TO APPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
3000-15664-0020 TRACING THIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE GOLIA CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS A HUGE PALM ZEST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYRE OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY
3000-15664-0021 REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORB IT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF GENIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP ROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS
3000-15664-0022 HERE HE STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE SLOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN
3000-15664-0023 MOUNT BRUMMAR IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP AND THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION
3000-15664-0024 LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PINES AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE AND THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AND EVERY ALARM
3000-15664-0025 WHILE TRAVELLING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE BLOCK
3000-15664-0026 THE MULE DARE ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY
3000-15664-0027 THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVEN THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE
3000-15664-0028 BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THEIR ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE I
3000-15664-0029 THEN FELL THE GLOBE MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS
3000-15664-0030 THEM DARKNESS LIKE DEATH
3000-15664-0031 TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCKS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK
3000-15664-0032 THE DECKS LESS WEARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS AND THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE
3000-15664-0033 THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSSE CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING AND SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVER LIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA
3000-15664-0034 THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MIC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE
3000-15664-0035 SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PIT RIVER THAN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN NEITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FALL THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT
3000-15664-0036 UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAIN I HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS
3000-15664-0037 THE VIVID GREEN OF THE MOLDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLORS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM
3000-15664-0038 A SPLENIUM IT BELOWBIUM WHO CHERRA HAZEL DOG WOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE IN SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA
3000-15664-0039 TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELERS
3000-15664-0040 AS THE LIFE BLADE OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE IS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES
3000-15664-0041 TRACING THEM A CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PIT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTT THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH THE FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICHO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAANTOR AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP
3000-15664-0042 THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE LIMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING
3000-15664-0043 THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN A AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES
3000-15664-0044 THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TARHOE
3000-15664-0045 THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYTHING DESTRCTABLE IN THEM IS BEING DESTROYED
3000-15664-0046 EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED ANDHERRIED
3081-166546-0000 WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNEXTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
3081-166546-0001 INSTANTLY THE ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
3081-166546-0002 YET AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
3081-166546-0003 THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BROTHERS BUT THEIR AUNT
3081-166546-0004 THE BOYS BELONG TO THAT GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
3081-166546-0005 GEORGIE NODDED
3081-166546-0006 THE BOYS LOOK RIGHT AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT
3081-166546-0007 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHELLENER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
3081-166546-0008 JOYCE
3081-166546-0009 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
3081-166546-0010 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPRABABLE
3081-166546-0011 THE BOYS LOOKS WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
3081-166546-0012 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM A QUARTER BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
3081-166546-0013 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS PURTIVE WATCHER
3081-166546-0014 I TOOKE QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
3081-166546-0015 I AM LOOKING AT YOU NOW
3081-166546-0016 JUST IN EVERY DAY DEDUCTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THROUGH
3081-166546-0017 YES HE'S A MORE COURAGE IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
3081-166546-0018 WHEN DOES HE WANT
3081-166546-0019 I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MYSIDE
3081-166546-0020 HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE PLACED MAY SEND ME
3081-166546-0021 I EMPHASIZED COMPLAISIVELY
3081-166546-0022 HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE PRICE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD AND SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
3081-166546-0023 HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ELERMENT FOR HIM
3081-166546-0024 THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE THE VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
3081-166546-0025 I BELIEVE WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
3081-166546-0026 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEARED I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
3081-166546-0027 HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHURCH
3081-166546-0028 IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER CHARGE
3081-166546-0029 THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLACED TO CONSIDER IT
3081-166546-0030 THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MEET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
3081-166546-0031 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE SPUNNEDLED UP LAKES AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
3081-166546-0032 IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE' THERE
3081-166546-0033 BUT SUPPOSE THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
3081-166546-0034 THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU COULD
3081-166546-0035 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE OPEN
3081-166546-0036 IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GLASS
3081-166546-0037 THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE DOOR
3081-166546-0038 SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HURT
3081-166546-0039 NOR WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
3081-166546-0040 IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY ABALT FROM HEAVEN
3081-166546-0041 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT ICE
3081-166546-0042 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BASKET YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
3081-166546-0043 A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOPPERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
3081-166546-0044 HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO JOYCE
3081-166546-0045 THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PRODIGIES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVORITE

3081-166546-0051 WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE BOBBY BELOW
3081-166546-0052 WHY OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
3081-166546-0053 CERTAINLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST

3081-166546-0059 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED BURRY I SHOULD SAY

3081-166546-0065 BUT NONE ALTOGETHER BY ME
3081-166546-0066 WHEREVER SHE BELIEVES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
3081-166546-0067 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME BUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE

3081-166546-0078 NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I WISH YOU SAY
3081-166546-0079 AND THE GLANCE WHICH CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYES SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
3081-166546-0080 I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOT
3081-166546-0081 THERE WAS NO PRIDE IN THE WOUND
3081-166546-0082 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLOCK WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
3081-166546-0083 I WILL COUPLE YOU NO FURTHER
3081-166546-0084 SWEETWATER HAVE ME OUT OF THIS
3081-166546-0085 BUT VIGOR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THINKED MISS CLARK AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
3081-166546-0086 THE NEXT MORNING SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
3081-166546-0087 NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZIGINE WHAT FOLLOWS
3081-166546-0088 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON END AND FLING IT FROM HER
3081-166546-0089 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THEREFORE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
3170-137482-0000 WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE INSUREED ME AN HONORABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY INSPIRED MEDIIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
3170-137482-0001 I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK AT THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR AND DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY
3170-137482-0002 I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISSPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE
3170-137482-0003 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSIONAL WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS ONCE AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER ONCE THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
3170-137482-0004 ARE SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED AS TO THE GREATEST DANGER
3170-137482-0005 WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INFANTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES
3170-137482-0006 WE DO THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SAT HALF DRESS TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH
3170-137482-0007 WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT A GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BILL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
3170-137482-0008 THIS IS THE MISSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS
3170-137482-0009 IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGAZIENO
3170-137482-0010 YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CANNOT ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
3170-137482-0011 THE WAITER OF THE MAGAZINEO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ADJOINING SILENCE UNDER PETALTY OF DEATH
3170-137482-0012 WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A CHARGE BOAT
3170-137482-0013 WELL IS MY HUSBAND
3170-137482-0014 THERE EVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
3170-137482-0015 MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE MADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
3170-137482-0016 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORJY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
3170-137482-0017 I WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR AND DRINKING
3170-137482-0018 THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRADER AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRAYERS WERE NOT RENEWED
3170-137482-0019 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO TO HIM
3170-137482-0020 I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE DAWN DOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
3170-137482-0021 I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMENESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
3170-137482-0022 I JUMPED OUT OF THE GOD DOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT VISITA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I INQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
3170-137482-0023 TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME AT A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLOOD AGAIN THUS IMPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
3170-137482-0024 THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED HIMSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
3170-137482-0025 THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST VIOLENCE
3170-137482-0026 HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATING WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
3170-137482-0027 THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED PERIL HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MATERIAL ORNAMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
3170-137482-0028 UNITED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
3170-137482-0029 HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUE
3170-137482-0030 WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE SOURCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
3170-137482-0031 UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NEWERABLE CALCULOUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT
3170-137482-0032 I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND MET HERE EXCELLENCY
3170-137482-0033 THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDEDED
3170-137482-0034 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO RAISN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
3170-137482-0035 HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DO NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
3170-137482-0036 IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT STAND THE ANSWER
3170-137482-0037 THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULATUS
3170-137482-0038 NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATING MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION
3170-137482-0039 THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER STONE THE UNIVERSAL PRENACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE
3170-137482-0040 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND ENSUPED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
3170-137482-0041 THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTTIES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES
3170-137482-0042 AS FOR THE EUQUEIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT POPULAR EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUITS
3170-137482-0043 I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDICEIVED THEM
3170-137482-0044 BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE THE DUE AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENA THEY MAKE WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
3170-137482-0045 WHOEVER WE MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
3170-137482-0046 YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT AT GUN DOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SECRETS A MONTH
3170-137482-0047 YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVICEER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
3170-137482-0048 I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY ATTITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
3536-23268-0000 SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DOREFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS WHARTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION
3536-23268-0001 EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS
3536-23268-0002 YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISSWOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE
3536-23268-0003 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY REFUSED FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOR OF HER RETURN
3536-23268-0004 I HOPE MISS MILLWARD YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
3536-23268-0005 I THOUGHT MISS MILLER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORTH THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
3536-23268-0006 YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD TAKE MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT
3536-23268-0007 MISSUS WHARTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT BROWN THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED
3536-23268-0008 NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIAL LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSSLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
3536-23268-0009 MISS MILLINGER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR
3536-23268-0010 AND SHE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR
3536-23268-0011 HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS WHARTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS CLOSE AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
3536-23268-0012 IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY OF TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HERS
3536-23268-0013 DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILLNA WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL
3536-23268-0014 IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT ME NOW
3536-23268-0015 PEACE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THE ROOM THIS EVENING
3536-23268-0016 MISS WOODLLY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED
3536-23268-0017 AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DURFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
3536-23268-0018 MISSWOODIE THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE JINGLE OF A TEASPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
3536-23268-0019 MISSUS WHARTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHATABLE
3536-23268-0020 MISS WOODSLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENTS COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
3536-23268-0021 HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVORED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILLOR CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER
3536-23268-0022 DORA FORTH RED ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARTED
3536-23268-0023 AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS WHARTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUKEFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILLER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA
3536-23268-0024 DOREFORE THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN
3536-23268-0025 IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANORALLY
3536-23268-0026 FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBBERS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM
3536-23268-0027 WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE ON HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPRESSED
3536-23268-0028 SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED
3536-23268-0029 ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHOW YOUR COMMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TODAY
3536-23268-0030 KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRAIGHT ME THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH
3536-8226-0000 IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBUH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
3536-8226-0001 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOSIL THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
3536-8226-0002 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE DICTATED IN HIS FAVOUR
3536-8226-0003 IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS COMPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
3536-8226-0004 MISSUS BOSWEL WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAM TEA WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
3536-8226-0005 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
3536-8226-0006 A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TRIVALLION ON TRIVALLION'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
3536-8226-0007 OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOSIL
3536-8226-0008 THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFLUENCE NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOSSEL'S LAW
3536-8226-0009 HE CAN'T SUCKLE HIM PENNNY
3536-8226-0010 WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVE TO GANN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
3536-8226-0011 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BE EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOSEL IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOSSEL TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
3536-8226-0012 DRAW THEM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
3536-8226-0013 IT'S THAT HAS MAKES HIM AND I WON'T SAY WHAT
3536-8226-0014 BUT AS FOR THIS NEAR CHILD BE
3536-8226-0015 TRAVALUION HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
3536-8226-0016 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOSSL LIVE HERE ASKED REBELLION
3536-8226-0017 THEN GASEL CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
3536-8226-0018 BUT TRAVALION WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
3536-8226-0019 BOSHIL HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
3536-8226-0020 IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOSL TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
3536-8226-0021 PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TRIMVILLE
3536-8226-0022 MISSUS BOSWAL WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
3536-8226-0023 BOSHLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3536-8226-0024 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TRIGGER
3536-8226-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SPINT SIR SUGGESTED BOSZLE
3536-8226-0026 AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
3536-8226-0027 AND ALL WORKING HAD CEASED WITH HIM
3536-8226-0028 HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A WINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
3536-8226-0029 I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP HIS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
3536-8226-0030 BUT IF YOU ASKED ME MY OPINION WHY IN HORSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
3536-8226-0031 AND BOSL AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
3536-8226-0032 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOSSY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
3576-138058-0000 MASTER AND MAN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SANCHO WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NOONTIME MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE A DUE PASSED THE GATES OF SLEEP
3576-138058-0001 BUT DON QUIXOTE WHOM HIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN HUNGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND ROAMED IN FANCY TO AND THROW THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES
3576-138058-0002 AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MONTASINOES AND SAW DOSINNAEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASKED AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MORLAND WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DELSINEA
3576-138058-0003 WHO WAS TOUCHING ME AND UNTRUSING ME
3576-138058-0004 DOCENNAYA IS PERISHING THOU ART LIVING ON REGARDLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE TOFERRED THEREFORE UNTRUST THYSELF WITH THE GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND GLASSES
3576-138058-0005 SEEING THIS SANCHO GOT UP AND GRAPPLING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRIPPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVING HIM A TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS BRIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR BREATHE
3576-138058-0006 HOW O TRAITTER EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE
3576-138058-0007 DOST DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND NATURAL LORD
3576-138058-0008 DOST THOU ARISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVES THEE HIS BREAD
3576-138058-0009 DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASE
3576-138058-0010 SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS COUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
3576-138058-0011 HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING UPON UNCLE QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM
3576-138058-0012 DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF
3576-138058-0013 SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FATE AND LEGS
3576-138058-0014 DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HOARSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVORABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY
3576-138058-0015 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PATRNALL'S IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
3576-138058-0016 HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE CENTRAL PONZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO CONSIST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED SO THE GIRL ESCAPED
3576-138058-0017 HE SAW ME HE PAID COURT TO ME I LISTENED TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER I LOVED HIM FOR THERE IS NO WOMAN HOWEVER SECCLUDED SHE MAY LIVE OR CLOSE SHE MAY BE KEPT WHO WILL NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND DESPAIR FOR FOLLOWING HER HEADLONG IMPULSES
3576-138058-0018 IN A WORD HE PLEDGED HIMSELF TO BE MINE AND I PROMISED TO BE HIS WITHOUT KILLING MATTERS ANY FURTHER
3576-138058-0019 GIVE ME MY HORSE AND ARMS AND WAIT FOR ME HERE I WILL GO IN QUESTION THIS NIGHT AND DEAD OR ALIVE I WILL MAKE HIM KEEP HIS WORD PLIGHTED TO SO GREAT BEAUTY
3576-138058-0020 NOBODY NEED HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SANCHO FOR MY MASTER HAS A VERY HAPPY NACK OF MATCH MAKING IT'S NOT MANY DAYS SINCE HE FORCED ANOTHER MAN TO MARY WHO IN THE SAME WAY BACKED OUT OF HIS PROMISE TO ANOTHER MAIDEN AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS PERSECUTERS THE ENCHANTERS CHANGING THE MAN'S PROPER SHAPE INTO A LACKEYS THE SAID MAIDEN WOULD NOT BE ONE THIS MINUTE
3576-138058-0021 THEY MADE HATE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH THESE
3576-138058-0022 THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGNIZING CLORDIA SAID I SEE CLEARLY FAIR AND MISTAKEN LADY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN ME HERE A PUNISHMENT NOT MERITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARD THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO NOR COULD I WRONG THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED
3576-138058-0023 IT IS NOT TRUE THEN SAID GLORDIA THE THOU'RT GOING THIS MORNING TO MARY LEONORA THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICH BY VESTRAL
3576-138058-0024 ON PERCEIVING THIS CLAUDIA WHEN SHE HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT HER BELOVED HUSBAND WAS NO MORE RENT THE AIR WITH HER SIGHS AND MADE THE HEAVEN'S RING WITH HER LAMENTATIONS SHE TORE HER HAIR AND SCATTERED IT TO THE WINDS SHE BEAT HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS OF GRIEF AND SORROW THAT COULD BE CONCEIVED TO COME FROM AN AFFLICTED HEART
3576-138058-0025 CRUEL RIDICULOUS WOMAN SHE CRIED HOW EASILY WERE THOU MOVED TO CARRY OUT A THOUGHT SO WICKED
