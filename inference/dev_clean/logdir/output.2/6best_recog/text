1988-147956-0006 THEY'LL GET FIXED UP COMFORTABLE AFTER A WHILE MISSUS MERRICK MAKE GOOD HOUSE
1988-147956-0007 MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TONE THE FOREIGNERS AS IF THEY WERE DEAF
1988-147956-0008 SHE MADE MISSUS MARE TO UNDERSTAND THE FRIENDLY INTENTION OF OUR VISIT AND THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN HANDLED THE LOAVES OF BREAD AND EVEN SMELLED THEM AND EXAMINED THE PYES WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY EXCLAIMING MUCH GOOD MUCH THINK
1988-147956-0009 THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORN CAKES AND SORGAM MALLASSES FOR THREE DAYS
1988-147956-0010 I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SET ABOUT HER EYES
1988-147956-0011 HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF WRETCHED DARK COLOUR
1988-147956-0012 EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SAY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
1988-147956-0013 HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS WERE REMARKED
1988-147956-0014 AMBROSH HE MADE GOOD FARMER
1988-147956-0015 HE STRUCK AMBRELSH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY
1988-147956-0016 AT THAT MOMENT THE FIVE CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK
1988-147956-0017 IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT THAT I REMEMBER IN VIRGINIA
1988-147956-0018 I NOTICED HOW LIGHT AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE
1988-147956-0019 WE STOOD PAINTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US
1988-147956-0020 THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HEAD ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM
1988-147956-0021 SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FIRMLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY
1988-147956-0022 SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTTONWOOD TREE BEHIND HIS TOP WE STOOD AND SET AGAIN WHAT NAME
1988-147956-0023 ANTONIA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH A GLANCE
1988-147956-0024 SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND ROUND HER HANDS
1988-147956-0025 SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY YOUNGER
1988-147956-0026 WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE BOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US
1988-147956-0027 AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASTE SILVER RING SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER
1988-147956-0028 WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FAITH FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
1988-147956-0029 I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED OF BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY ELDERS
1988-148538-0000 IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTS AND BOISTEROUS GAYETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACYIES ARE NOT FONT OF BEING THUS FILNCY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELF WITHOUT REGRET
1988-148538-0001 AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A MEASURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESULT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUED TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
1988-148538-0002 I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES HOTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
1988-148538-0003 THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRETIC COMMUNITIES
1988-148538-0004 THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE FORTUNE
1988-148538-0005 I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATEO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OFF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACYES WERE COMPOSIVE VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LETTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
1988-148538-0006 IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN IS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH THE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST THEM ACREVIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
1988-148538-0007 CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS IN CAPTUREES THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
1988-148538-0008 THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THE SMALLEST CENJURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE
1988-148538-0009 IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY WHO LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AY HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
1988-148538-0010 IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS AND JOY HE HAUNTS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
1988-148538-0011 IN ARIS TO CREDIT COUNTRIES THE GREATS POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACRUSE OF THEM
1988-148538-0012 THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF FOUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERY ONE PERCEIVES AT NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
1988-148538-0013 THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WHILE ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
1988-148538-0014 WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FOON WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CAUSES OF THE NATION
1988-148538-0015 THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PURE ALL JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRACYES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE EQUALLY CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE A SENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION
1988-24833-0000 THE TWO STRAIT KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
1988-24833-0001 SOMEHOW OR OTHER CAP HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR PUD NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING
1988-24833-0002 SHE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SHE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASTH MA

1988-24833-0014 PAPA GOES RIGHT ON HEARING HIS CHANNEL
1988-24833-0015 YOU' ARE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
1988-24833-0016 IT'S YOUR FALL MODER UP YOURSELF
1988-24833-0017 I HEAR THE TEA VE GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MORROW
1988-24833-0018 WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A NICE TUBE PROG ROOM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
1988-24833-0019 I LOOK AT MY WATCH ITS A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
1988-24833-0020 I TURN OFF THE TELELOGE AND SAID I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S A SPOOK AFTER ALL
1988-24833-0021 IT'S THE FIRST TIME HEDDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND
1988-24833-0022 I TOLD TIME WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAID TILDA

1988-24833-0024 TOM DRANKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THAN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON HIS FLOURISH UP JOB
1988-24833-0025 YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANY WAY
1988-24833-0026 I'VE DECIDED TO ENDLESS IN THE ARMY

1988-24833-0028 HEAR'S TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
1993-147149-0000 HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GOVERNED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH
1993-147149-0001 WHAT BANKRUPTS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSEOUS CREDITOR SEIZES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS
1993-147149-0002 THE GREW LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BOXED OF ITS PREY
1993-147149-0003 THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOUT CLEPLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PARISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT
1993-147149-0004 MARGARET MET HIM WELL SINCE SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
1993-147149-0005 SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LAPTCH OF THE WILSON'S DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
1993-147149-0006 SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN BUT SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON ABOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SURFACE A TEA IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
1993-147149-0007 OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATHED THE FATHER MEANT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
1993-147149-0008 IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE TAKE YOU
1993-147149-0009 BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UP STAIRS AS IF AFRAID AWAKENING HIM
1993-147149-0010 WISHING HIM SAID MARRY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY
1993-147149-0011 AGAIN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
1993-147149-0012 HER CRY BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
1993-147149-0013 MARIAN ALICE WITHDREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
1993-147149-0014 THEN ALICE WROTE THE SILENCE BY SAYING
1993-147149-0015 BEFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FOLKS COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD NOW YOU HAD HEARD HOW I HAVE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
1993-147149-0016 BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURTY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
1993-147149-0017 OH JAMES DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
1993-147149-0018 HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HANDS TOUCHED THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPEREDING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
1993-147149-0019 DON'T JIM PLEASE DONT WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF
1993-147149-0020 MARY I ALMOST BLOW MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PASSED AND GONE AND MARRY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
1993-147149-0021 HE REMAINED UPSTAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED IN QUIET STREETS TO TRY GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
1993-147149-0022 SO LEADING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JIM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
1993-147149-0023 HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JIMM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
1993-147149-0024 I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN IS DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WITH HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
1993-147149-0025 I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHECKED MYSELF TILL I'M DOWN RIGHT ACROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
1993-147149-0026 BUT WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT
1993-147149-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORTHLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMPSON'S YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
1993-147149-0028 THE OLD LEVIN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER ANSTER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
1993-147149-0029 IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMONS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GROUNDS FROM THE HASTY TEMPER YET KIND DRESSMAKER
1993-147149-0030 BUT THE BEST OF HER FRIENDS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS IT IS HEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON
1993-147964-0000 THEY SAID ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GRACING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLEADING WHIP LASHES
1993-147964-0001 ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A GRAIN
1993-147964-0002 I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YOLKA AND ANTONIA EVEN YOLKAH WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
1993-147964-0003 SHE CUT SQUIRES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
1993-147964-0004 ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS IN ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET TONGUE TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
1993-147964-0006 I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAQUE
1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME AT VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A QUARTER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A RECOLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JANE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURE SO RUDELY MOULDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE
1993-147965-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING THE WHITE SHOOT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
1993-147965-0001 MORNING PRAYERS WERE LOWER THAN USUAL
1993-147965-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR A FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR INVESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT YOUTH
1993-147965-0004 ALL AFTERNOON HE SET IN THE DINING ROOM
1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER CHAMURDO WEARING HIS RABBIT'SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEWMENTS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
1993-147965-0006 HE SAT STILL AND MASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
1993-147965-0007 HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEAR RELIEF FROM PAIN
1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE ACROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEARS DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY FLESH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSISSUMURRA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS IN CURTAINS IN FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN AMVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
1993-147966-0002 YOUR MAMMA I SAID EAGERLY ONCE OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS

1993-147966-0006 YOU'VE GOT A WORTHY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
2035-147960-0000 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDR THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER
2035-147960-0001 THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD GATHER
2035-147960-0002 ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE CHIMERTOS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBRUSH NEEDED
2035-147960-0003 THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEADTY AS WINE
2035-147960-0004 IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MEET MY ADVENTURE
2035-147960-0005 I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD NEVER SEEN

2035-147960-0007 I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE GEM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
2035-147960-0008 A FAINT FETED SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID USED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
2035-147960-0009 LOOK TONEY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
2035-147960-0010 I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MAN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO IN INDIAN TIMES
2035-147960-0011 WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUE IT HOME AND I WOULD WALK
2035-147960-0012 I FOLLOWED WITH A SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGON MY SNAKE

2035-147960-0014 YOU COULD STAND RIGHT UP IN TALK TO YOU HE GOOD DID HE FIGHT HARD
2035-147960-0015 I DON'T WIN AT ME
2035-147960-0016 THE SNAKE OF HIS SIZE AND FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE
2035-147961-0000 PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHAWRIDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONNESS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE HIM MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTTER
2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DORNUTS FOR US
2035-147961-0003 I LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRY
2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GROWTH WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BEDROOM
2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THEIR ROOM
2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DECILE
2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN WAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
2035-147961-0010 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WOULD WRONG THEM
2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I FELT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
2035-147961-0012 HE LAID PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
2035-147961-0013 ANTEY'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
2035-147961-0014 FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE'S BODY WAS
2035-147961-0015 GRADUALLY RELEASE CAME TO ALL OF US
2035-147961-0016 WITHOUT A WORD PETER BROUGHT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
2035-147961-0017 MISTER SHOEMAIN WENT WITH HIM
2035-147961-0018 AFTER THE CEREMONY THAT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
2035-147961-0019 THE FIRST HULLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS

2035-147961-0022 THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MIGHT EVERYBODY SOBER
2035-147961-0023 THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOMS THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
2035-147961-0024 THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGEES LEFT HE WHISPERED
2035-147961-0025 AND THE WOLF'S PABBLE ASKED IN HALF ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US

2035-147961-0031 PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SO NOTHING
2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAN AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE READING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE GONE OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED HIM
2035-147961-0035 THEY WERE TO CHICAGO DES MOINES FOR AT WANE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
2035-147961-0036 DURING THE ARUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES
2035-147961-0037 EVERYBODY SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER

2035-152373-0001 THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGAL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LASCENTIOUS BARS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARRA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION
2035-152373-0002 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF STRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MORA

2035-152373-0004 LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY RANG JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE
2035-152373-0005 IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SON GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEART STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BELLE MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE IMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE

2035-152373-0011 THE BARE AND ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH THE MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS
2035-152373-0012 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FOR MY HONOR HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL
2035-152373-0013 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF LEAF THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONET WAS PITCHED ON THE WRATH OF TARRA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
2035-152373-0014 SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY FUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE

2086-149214-0000 THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF OBTAINMENT
2086-149214-0001 IN GOOD FACE HOWEVER HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPAL THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PEN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE
2086-149214-0003 IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNEXION WHICH THE SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
2086-149214-0004 HE TRUSTED NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT ENFRIINGS UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATEING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
2086-149220-0000 THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEYMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUT BUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET
2086-149220-0001 THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSE BUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND THE PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMPSEN TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRENT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT IMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS
