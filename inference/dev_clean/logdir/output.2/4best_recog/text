1988-147956-0006 DON'LL GET FIXED UP COMFORTABLE AFTER A WHILE MISSUS MERRICK MAKE GOOD HOUSE
1988-147956-0007 MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TONE TO FOREIGNERS AS IF THEY WERE DEATH
1988-147956-0008 SHE MADE MISSUS MARY TO UNDERSTAND THE FRIENDLY INTENTION OF OUR VISIT AND THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN HANDLED THE LOAVES OF BREAD AND EVEN SMELLED THEM AND EXAMINED THE PYES WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY EXCLAIMING MUCH GOOD MUCH THINK
1988-147956-0009 THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORN CAKES AND SORGAM MOLASSES FOR THREE DAYS
1988-147956-0010 I REMEMBERED WHAT THE PRODUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES
1988-147956-0011 HER SKIN WAS BROWN TWO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOUR
1988-147956-0012 EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
1988-147956-0013 HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT OTHERS ARE SMART
1988-147956-0014 AMBUSH HE MADE GOOD FARMER
1988-147956-0015 HE STRUCK EMBUSH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY
1988-147956-0016 AT THAT MOMENT THE FIRE CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK
1988-147956-0017 IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT PUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT THAT REMEMBER IN VIRGINIA
1988-147956-0018 I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAKED HIS OWN HANDS WERE
1988-147956-0019 WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF A RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US
1988-147956-0020 THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HUT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM
1988-147956-0021 SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS HE COULD NOT SAY
1988-147956-0022 SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTTON WOODS TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME
1988-147956-0023 ANTONIA APPOINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH HER GLANCE
1988-147956-0024 SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND RUN HER HANDS
1988-147956-0025 HE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAGER
1988-147956-0026 WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREES IN FRONT OF US
1988-147956-0027 AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASED SILVER RING SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER
1988-147956-0028 WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVEN SECONDS
1988-147956-0029 I BECOME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY ELDERS
1988-148538-0000 IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAYETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACYIES ARE NOT FONT OF BEING THUS FILNCY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELF WITHOUT REGRET
1988-148538-0001 AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MARLY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESULT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUED TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
1988-148538-0002 I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISEES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
1988-148538-0003 THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM THE DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES
1988-148538-0004 THEN THERE ARE IN OLD CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONCERTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE FORTUNE
1988-148538-0005 I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATEO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OFF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACY WERE COMPOS OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LETTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
1988-148538-0006 IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN IS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH THE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST THEM ACCREDIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
1988-148538-0007 CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS IN CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
1988-148538-0008 THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT TO THE SMALLEST CENDURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE
1988-148538-0009 IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AH HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
1988-148538-0010 IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS AND JOY HE WANTS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
1988-148538-0011 IN ARIS TO CREDIT COUNTRIES THE GREATS POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACRUSE THEM
1988-148538-0012 THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF FOUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERYONE PERCEIVES AT NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE PUBLICS OF CONVERSATION
1988-148538-0013 THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURE THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
1988-148538-0014 WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FOOM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CAUSES OF THE NATION
1988-148538-0015 THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PURE ALL JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRACYIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE EQUALLY CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE A SENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION
1988-24833-0000 THE TWO STRAY KITTINGS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
1988-24833-0001 SOMEHOW OR OTHER CAP HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR FUND NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING
1988-24833-0002 SHE DOESN'T PICKED THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SHE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASMA

1988-24833-0014 PAPA GOES RIGHT ON TAKING HIS CHANNEL
1988-24833-0015 YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TWO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
1988-24833-0016 IT'S YOUR FALL ROBIN UP YOURSELF
1988-24833-0017 I HEAR THE TEA BE GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MAMMA
1988-24833-0018 WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A NICE TEDDY PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
1988-24833-0019 I LOOK AT MY WATCH IN'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
1988-24833-0020 I TURN OFF THE TELELOGE AND SAID I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S A SPOKE AFTER ALL
1988-24833-0021 IT'S THE FIRST TIME ILLDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND
1988-24833-0022 I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAID SILDA
1988-24833-0023 TOP SAYS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HELDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
1988-24833-0024 TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THAN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON HIS FLOWER SHOP JOB
1988-24833-0025 YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAUGHT IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
1988-24833-0026 I'VE DECIDED TO AM LESS IN THE ARMY
1988-24833-0027 I'LL HAVE TO CHICK SOME MORE SAYS TOM
1988-24833-0028 HERES TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
1993-147149-0000 HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARDENERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH
1993-147149-0001 WHAT BANKRUPTS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS
1993-147149-0002 THE JEWEL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BOXED OF ITS PREY
1993-147149-0003 THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOKE CLIPPLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PERISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT
1993-147149-0004 MARGARET MET JIM WILL SINCE SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
1993-147149-0005 SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSON'S DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTEN TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
1993-147149-0006 SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATHLIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN BUT SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SURFACE A TEA IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
1993-147149-0007 OVER THE CHILD WHICH HAD BREATHED THE FATHER SPENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
1993-147149-0008 IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THING YOU
1993-147149-0009 BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH AND HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UPSTAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF AWAKENING HIM
1993-147149-0010 WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF ENQUIRY
1993-147149-0011 THEN THE OTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
1993-147149-0012 HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND NOW TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
1993-147149-0013 MARIAN ALICE STOOD NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
1993-147149-0014 THEN ALICE STRUCK THE SILENCE BY SAYING
1993-147149-0015 BEFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FOOL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD NOW YOU HAD HEARD HOW I HAVE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
1993-147149-0016 BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FLAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
1993-147149-0017 OH JAM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
1993-147149-0018 HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HANDS TOUCHED THROWED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
1993-147149-0019 DON'T JIM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF BRIEF
1993-147149-0020 MARY I ALMOST BLOWED MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PASSED AND GONE AND MARRY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
1993-147149-0021 HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED IN QUIET STREETS TO TRYING GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
1993-147149-0022 SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JAMES AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
1993-147149-0023 HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JIM'S MANNER IN WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
1993-147149-0024 I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HIS DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WITH HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
1993-147149-0025 I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I RATHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWN RIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
1993-147149-0026 BUT WILL HE SANK BEFORE IT
1993-147149-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWWARDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMON'S YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
1993-147149-0028 THE OLD LEVIN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER ANCESTORS FORMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
1993-147149-0029 IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMONS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER
1993-147149-0030 BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS IT IS HARTENED GLOOMY PERSON
1993-147964-0000 THEY SAID ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GRECING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLATEING WHIP LASHES
1993-147964-0001 ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRING
1993-147964-0002 I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YOLCA AND ANTONIA EVEN YOLKA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
1993-147964-0003 SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SHEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
1993-147964-0004 ON THE WAY PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDFATHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
1993-147964-0006 I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JACK
1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREASON FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SNOWING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STUFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JANE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOULDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE
1993-147965-0000 GRANDMOTHER CAME DOWN WEARING THE WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
1993-147965-0001 MORNING PRAIRIES WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
1993-147965-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR A FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR INSTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WARREN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
1993-147965-0004 ALL AFTERNOON YOU SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER CHAMURDO WEARING HIS RABBIT'SKIN CABIN COLLAR AND NEW ITANCE HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
1993-147965-0006 HE SAT STILL AND PASSEDIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
1993-147965-0007 HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FOR PAIN
1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OR ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEARS DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRACE FLESH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDOW AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSISSUMURDO HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS IN CURTAINS IN FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
1993-147966-0002 YOUR MAMMA I SAID EAGERLY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
1993-147966-0003 FOR AMBOWS MY MAMMA COME HERE
1993-147966-0004 BUT YOU SEE ALTHOUGH HE NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN HIM

1993-147966-0006 YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
2035-147960-0000 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTESTING MANNER
2035-147960-0001 THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD ALTOGETHER
2035-147960-0002 ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE CHIMEERTOS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBRASH NEEDED
2035-147960-0003 THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEAVY HIS WINE
2035-147960-0004 IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY VENTURE
2035-147960-0005 I HURLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN
2035-147960-0006 I KNOW I'M SO AWFUL JIM WAS SO SCARED
2035-147960-0007 I NEVER KNOW YOU IS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
2035-147960-0008 A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID USED FROM HIS CROSSED HEAD
2035-147960-0009 LOOK TOWNY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
2035-147960-0010 I EXPLAINED ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO IN INDIAN TIMES
2035-147960-0011 WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DO IT HOME AND I WOULD WALK
2035-147960-0012 I FOLLOWED WITH A SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER RAGING MY SNAKE
2035-147960-0013 UDO FOLKS WAS THE FIRST WHEN WE MET
2035-147960-0014 YOU COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE GOOD DID HE FIGHT HEART
2035-147960-0015 I DON'T THINK AT ME
2035-147960-0016 A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE AND FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE
2035-147961-0000 PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER CHIMERIDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONNESS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE HIM MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOMNUTS FOR US
2035-147961-0003 WE LATE STILL AND DID NOT TALK
2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILL SIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GIRLS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT MAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SWELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND SOCILE
2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FISTS
2035-147961-0010 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WOULD WRONGD HIM
2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY I WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR DEATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
2035-147961-0013 ANTEIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
2035-147961-0014 FROM OUR BEN SHOULD WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
2035-147961-0015 GRADUALLY YOUR RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
2035-147961-0016 WITHOUT A WORD PETER SHOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
2035-147961-0017 MISTER SCHEMAIN WENT WITH HIM
2035-147961-0018 AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE BRIDE
2035-147961-0019 THE FIRST HALS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS
2035-147961-0020 A BLOCK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY

2035-147961-0022 THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MAKE EVERYBODY SOBER
2035-147961-0023 THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GNOME'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
2035-147961-0024 THEY ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LAUGHED HE WHISPERED
2035-147961-0025 AND THE WOLF'S PEBBLE ASKED IN HALF ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US

2035-147961-0028 TWENTY THIRTY NINE
2035-147961-0029 NOW HIS LITTLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
2035-147961-0030 POBBLE KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
2035-147961-0031 PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SCENE SAW NOTHING
2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE QUEEN AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE WON OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOW THEM
2035-147961-0035 THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINE FOR IT WANE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
2035-147961-0036 DURING AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES
2035-147961-0037 EVERYONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW HONOR
2035-147961-0038 THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER CHIMERDA

2086-149214-0001 IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER HE HAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE REENTLESSLY TO IMPAIL THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PIN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE
2086-149214-0003 IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNECTION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
2086-149214-0004 HE TRUSTED NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT ENFRIINGS UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RITES AND APPROPRIATEING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
2086-149220-0000 THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONSTRUCTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUT BUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET
