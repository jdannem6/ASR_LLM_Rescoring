3752-4944-0061 HO LORD LOOKED DOWN UPON ME
3752-4944-0062 HE MIXED A TEA SPOON OF THIS AND A PANNIKIN OF WATER AND DRANK IT
3752-4944-0063 IT WE LEAVEED HIM FOR A WHILE
3752-4944-0064 IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD REACH THE CRISIS OF A DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN FOR DAYS GATHERING FORCE
3752-4944-0065 I MUST HAVE A TEASPOONFUL HE SAID TO AWAY THE CRAVING
3752-4944-0066 TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVING ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL
3752-4944-0067 HE SMELT THE NUTTYIERROME OF THE SPIRIT
3752-4944-0068 THAT AT ALL TIMES DEBASING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS INFAMOUS THAT A VICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DUUBLY SINFUL IN A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN VAIN
3752-4944-0069 IN THE MIDST OF HIS ARGUMENTS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE CUPBOARD WITH THE BODY LET HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLE
3853-163249-0000 HER MEETING WITH LIGHT WAS INDESCRIBABLELY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
3853-163249-0001 BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRODGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
3853-163249-0002 SO CRISTY TURNED TO DEFIER TO HER PATHETIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
3853-163249-0003 NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I AM PREPARED FOR ANYTHING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVER DANCING A JIC
3853-163249-0004 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST JOIN MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
3853-163249-0005 I'M NOT A TALKER YOU NOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
3853-163249-0006 I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET APPOINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
3853-163249-0007 I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROST BIT AN OLD DAY THAT YOU FIRST KNEW AND WE'RE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE
3853-163249-0008 MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST READY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD
3853-163249-0009 IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD AND IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CRISTY A TOW IN THAT SUIT
3853-163249-0010 EXCELLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUOSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED ME AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
3853-163249-0011 I SHALL WAIT FOR TIME TO SELL
3853-163249-0012 THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SIMILAR AXES HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
3853-163249-0013 TO NO HOME AND THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
3853-163249-0014 DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARRK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
3853-163249-0015 IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET VARIOUS
3853-163249-0016 DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEAR HER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT EYE EYE IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
3853-163249-0017 THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST MAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
3853-163249-0018 YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWER BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOUR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
3853-163249-0019 THEN IT WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND THE GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS TO SAW THEM FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
3853-163249-0020 HE'S A KIND NARROWLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY
3853-163249-0021 I KNEW IT WOULD GO I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW
3853-163249-0022 YOU WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CRESTY STEALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM
3853-163249-0023 YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SAW IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO
3853-163249-0024 NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN AND ARMY BLEW ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNS SOLDIERLY CHOKED THE VOICE
3853-163249-0025 THE LOYAL FRIENDS THEY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
3853-163249-0026 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY NABSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
3853-163249-0027 FINDING THAT LYCHA SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TOROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS
3853-163249-0028 VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WELCOMES RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF IF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON HIS STOMACH AND SEE HOW VITAL WORK
3853-163249-0029 WE CAN'T AVOID NO NICE FIDDLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERING SO
3853-163249-0030 HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLYEN PULSES TO UP AND ATOM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IRONFUL BRANDISHING OF ALLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SOLE LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER
3853-163249-0031 TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROWS AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BEAT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN
3853-163249-0032 CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR LONG SUFFERING CREATURES NAMES
3853-163249-0033 KNOW HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAYOR ADDED ANNE LIZZY
3853-163249-0034 NOW SINK BE YOU SATISFIED
3853-163249-0035 AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS PUTNEY BREAST WEEPING COPIOUSLY
3853-163249-0036 HIS WIFE SAID HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED INTO APPLAUD ADVISED AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3853-163249-0037 THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHORTED THEBURTON SHE HAD BORN SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE
3853-163249-0038 THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK IN LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTANT WAS PRECIOUS
3853-163249-0039 THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STURLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
3853-163249-0040 NOW LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOYMENT EVERY MINUTE OF IT
3853-163249-0041 WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOUR DAVY ASKED CRISTY WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO
3853-163249-0042 AS AN MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED HERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
3853-163249-0043 NOTHING CAN IMPART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER
3853-163249-0044 NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVED CRISTY
3853-163249-0045 THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THIS SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER
3853-163249-0046 SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO AKE AS IT NEVER HAS AKED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
3853-163249-0047 DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANYTHING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER IN BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK AND TO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
3853-163249-0048 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE GOFFIN
3853-163249-0049 BUT I THINK FEW BROAD'S DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING GOWN ANSWERED CRISTY SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WOOLEN STUFF
3853-163249-0050 MISTER POWER IS WAITING ARE YOU ALREADY LOVE QUITE READY
3853-163249-0051 YOU YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WELL WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
3853-163249-0052 DAVID AND CRISTY WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY STORIES OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
3853-163249-0053 A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIED FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORN THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH HER SONG WAS LET HIS BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVID'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
3853-163249-0054 ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET AND A WAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EGGED BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
3853-163249-0055 THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND A REGIMENT BECAME ONE MAN TO HER
3853-163249-0056 I COULD NOT LOVE THE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED THY NOT HONOUR MORE
422-122949-0000 EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OFWORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER
422-122949-0001 THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CAST PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE WORLD OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENCE OF ALL SORTS
422-122949-0002 WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY AND ANCIENT GREENS CALLED THEMSELVES
422-122949-0003 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVITIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED
422-122949-0004 HE HONORS WHATEVER HE REALIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION
422-122949-0005 PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDENATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION
422-122949-0006 HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE SEEMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED
422-122949-0007 ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSEDS FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THE DISPICABLE BEING
422-122949-0008 EVERYWHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAMES THE ASCENDANCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORD GOOD AND STUPID
422-122949-0009 OR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION ANDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DID NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY
422-122949-0010 IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINAL NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER PAMPLER AND MORATICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE NUMBER OF VANITIES THIS OLDERPENSITY ABOVEMASTERS THE YOUNGER
422-122949-0011 THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT ENVELOPS TO MATURITY
422-122949-0012 VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE AND THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOUR THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND ATTACH HIMSELF
422-122949-0013 AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THEIR MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UPGROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND LAND CAN NO LONGER ASSION ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FOURBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING CORDIALITY
422-122949-0014 NOTHING BUT KNEW WISE NOTHING BUT NEW HOWLS NO COMMON FORMUL AS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNIC COPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A FORTENTIOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL EXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION
422-122949-0015 DANGERS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE NEIGHBOUR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREETS INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS
422-122949-0016 WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAL AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH
422-122949-0017 THIS IS A PROBLEM OF RACE
422-122949-0018 IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBEIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DISEASEING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBIANISM AND BODY AND SOUL
422-122949-0019 THE NOBLE SOUL EXCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS CONSTRAINED OR ARBITRARYNESS THEREIN BUT RATHER A SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF
422-122949-0020 ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER REQUIREMENT TOIL THEIR ORIGINATES THEIR FROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION
422-122949-0021 THE GREATER THE DANGER THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN DANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH INTERCOURSE
422-122949-0022 ALSO WHEN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHEN THE DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES AS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER
422-122949-0023 WHICH EVER GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN A SOUL AWAKEN MOST READILY BEGIN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THESE DECIDED AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS
422-122949-0024 A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAYS SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREIN IT SEES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINGSIC NEEDS
422-122949-0025 PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE IT SEPARATES ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISGUISE IS EPIGUREISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS ITSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND
422-122949-0026 THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO IS AFFECTED WITH IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SAINT FOR IT IS JUST WHOLELINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION
422-122949-0027 OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE THE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEIR BEST YOUTH IN STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HIS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS ARE NOW TOO HEAVY
422-122949-0028 AND WHOOEVER THOU ART WHAT IS IT THAT NOW PLEASES THEE
422-122949-0029 ONLY NAME IT WHATEVER I HAVE I AUTHOR THEE
422-122949-0030 BUT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM WHEN YOU CONTAIN ABOUT IT
422-122949-0031 THERE MUST BE A SORT OF IMPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVE ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME ENIGMA THEREIN
422-122949-0032 PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING FOR MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I PROLONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IT IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
422-122949-0033 I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARDPIECE HAVE FLOWN OVER MY TABLE
422-122949-0034 TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESPIS OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO
422-122949-0035 AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND CHEERFUL VISE POLITENESS
5338-24615-0000 IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR RATHER HAMLET OF TWO LEVEILLON CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETOR
5338-24615-0001 THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN EYE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING MEEKNESS OF THE ENGLISH COTTAGES
5338-24615-0002 OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSUMMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDDAM WITH HER CLOSE CAP DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSHED LIKE A SIBYL AND FRENZY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE CELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNBURNT LOITERERS SALUTED HIM WITH A SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM WITH TO HIS DOWNCOURGEON THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VIRLETS SCREAMING ALL THE MOUTH FROM THE VERY TOP OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLLY TROUBLE TO THE ENDOWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MACTRON
5338-24615-0003 THE EVIL AND REMEDY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENIS DOGVILLE
5338-24615-0004 YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES AND FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MENERVA
5338-24615-0005 THIS AVENUE WAS STRAIGHT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROW OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESTNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SYCOMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHTS AND NOURISHED SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOUGHS COMPLETELY OVERARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BENEATH
5338-24615-0006 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOUGHS OF THE SHADY ARK THAT VAULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY
5338-24615-0007 THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NARROW AND STEEP DRIFT BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE
5338-24615-0008 IT HAD BEEN BUILT IT A PERIOD WHEN CASTLES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESIGNING A DOMESTIC RESIDENCE
5338-24615-0009 NEITHER COULD THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER
5338-24615-0010 STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED IN OTHER SIGHT OF THE SQUARE
5338-24615-0011 TWO BASKETED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE ENCLOSURE
5338-24615-0012 THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDERFUL OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND
5338-24615-0013 THE COURT WAS FACES WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITTER
5338-24615-0014 EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SCENE STILL MAINTAINED THE MANASTIC ILLUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAY ORLEY HAD CONQUERED UP
5338-24640-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDATE
5338-24640-0001 MISTER MARK REPLIED THE FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT
5338-24640-0002 EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MARTIN OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAUGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE
5338-24640-0003 MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAY LOUISE VISIT TO DONALD BEAM LEAN
5338-24640-0004 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HAIR REIGNED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME
5338-24640-0005 HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDES FEAR IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR INCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
5338-24640-0006 MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAY RELEASE INTERVIEW WITH DON OLD BEING LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
5338-24640-0007 HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INQUIRIANCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUISITION
5338-24640-0008 THEY HELD CONTENTABLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TO GARMENTS DURING THOSE RAINS
5338-24640-0009 SINCE THAT TIME THERE NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH THE BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT
5338-284437-0000 IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY CLEAN IN APPEARANCE
5338-284437-0001 HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TWENTY WHO IS OUR QUEEN
5338-284437-0002 WHAT THAT LITTLE CAPTAIN
5338-284437-0003 EXCLAIMED TROIT OF COURSE
5338-284437-0004 DID YOU SUPPOSE A PARIS WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
5338-284437-0005 THESE INTRUDEERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD
5338-284437-0006 MAY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
5338-284437-0007 THE PEOPLE MUST GO OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE
5338-284437-0008 SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN HER ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAW A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARTING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
5338-284437-0009 SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIS BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
5338-284437-0010 HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROP SKIN
5338-284437-0011 WHAT IS IT QUARRELLEY SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
5338-284437-0012 THE QUEEN GAZED ON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST
5338-284437-0013 SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE A BUTTON BRIGHT OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAPTAIN MILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
5338-284437-0014 ARE YOU A GIGANT
5338-284437-0015 PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDO KILL ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY
5338-284437-0016 THERE ARE NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
5338-284437-0017 COOLLY DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN
5338-284437-0018 EVEN IN AMERICA EVERYBODY BOWS LOADED OUR PRESIDENT AND THE BLUE SKINS ARE SO FRIGHTENED OF THEIR BULLAROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM
5338-284437-0019 BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TORNILLING GRAVELY
5338-284437-0020 THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS
5338-284437-0021 IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOUR TITLE TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
5338-284437-0022 IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINK HEAPS WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
5338-284437-0023 NO MY WAY IS BEST
5338-284437-0024 THE QUEEN IS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADDRESS GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER
5338-284437-0025 WE HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE
5338-284437-0026 AFTER MY DEATH THE PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKEYS AND AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOUR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
5338-284437-0027 A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FAITH
5338-284437-0028 IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FOOD
5338-284437-0029 YES IT WAS BET AND STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AND WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
5338-284437-0030 YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKEYS AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
5338-284437-0031 IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND
5338-284437-0032 WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUE SKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE ARE CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HEAR AND I REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
5338-284437-0033 I'LL LOOK IN THE GRAY BOOK FIRST
5536-43358-0000 THE SAVAGE PHILOSOPHER THE DUELL MINE
5536-43358-0001 THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT MYSTERY THAT SURROUNDS THAT EMBRACES US WAS AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS EXALTED
5536-43358-0002 IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ASCEND TO GOD AND WORDLESS ADORATION
5536-43358-0003 NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR CONFESS OR IN ANY WAY MADAM WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER
5536-43358-0004 AMONG ITS ALL MEN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY
5536-43358-0005 THAT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED IN THE WORD BAM DAY LITERALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY TRANSLATED FASTING IN DREAMING
5536-43358-0006 THE FIRST BAMBA DAY OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARTON EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CONFIRMATION OR CONVERSION IN THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE
5536-43358-0007 KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS OR SACRIFICEES OTHER THAN SYMBOLIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO
5536-43358-0008 AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNRAS OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVERLOOKING THE GLORY OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF HIS ARMY FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER
5536-43358-0009 WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THE VAPER BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS
5536-43358-0010 IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANT OR IN PROVIDENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION
5536-43358-0011 TO THE ONTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PRELIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL
5536-43358-0012 IN THIS TOUCH OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF FAVOR OR HELP
5536-43358-0013 FROM THE SON AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRESSBALL IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER TO EARTH OUR HIDDEN EMBROES OF PLANTS AND MEN
5536-43358-0014 THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL PRESS
5536-43358-0015 NOTHING OF THE MARVELLOUS COULD ASTONISH HIM AS THAT A BEAST SHOULD SPEAK OR THE SUN STANDS UNTIL
5536-43358-0016 WHO MAY CONDUCT HIS SUPERSTITION
5536-43358-0017 HERE IS THE SUPREME HISTORY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH AWE THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION
5536-43358-0018 IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPPING MILLIONS OF THE RICH NEIGHBOR
5536-43358-0019 THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THE UNION WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS WEALTH
5536-43359-0000 HE HAD NEITHER A NATIONAL ARMY NOR AN ORGANIZE CHURCH
5536-43359-0001 HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO INSTILL UNTIL THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THE SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION
5536-43359-0002 THE ORDEAL IS BEST MET ALONE WERE NO CURIOUS OR PITYING EYES EMBARRASS HER WHERE ALL NATURE SAYS TO HER SPIRIT TIS LOVE HIS LOVE THE FULFILLING OF LIFE
5536-43359-0003 MISS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER IN THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE BUT SHE HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANT'S BEE'S SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS
5536-43359-0004 IN VIEW TIME THE CHILD TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVERENTLY OF THE POWERS
5536-43359-0005 INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENCE IS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THE YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
5536-43359-0006 THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNIVE BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT
5536-43359-0007 THE REMOTER DEGREES OF KINGSHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNIZED AND THAT NOT AS A MATTER OF FORM ONLY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM AND A RIGID MORALITY FOR BADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS AND ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CLAN
5536-43359-0008 WHEN SHE FOUND THE WHOLE RAYS FELL WITH HER
5536-43359-0009 BEFORE THIS CALAMITY CAME UPON US SHE COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE HAPPIER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INION WOMAN
5536-43359-0010 HIS DAILY DEVOTIONS ARE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD
5536-43359-0011 WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON A SCENE THAT IS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDERCLODE WITH THE RAINBOS GOING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN A WHITE WATERFALL IN THE HEART OF THE GREEN GORGE A VAST PRAIRIE TINGE WITH THE BLOOD RED OF SUNSET HE PAUSES FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP
5536-43359-0012 WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LOOKS TO MAKE A NOTABLE EFFORT TO PROVE HIS GRATITUDE
5536-43359-0013 HE CUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSEL OF THE MEAT AND CAST IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST ETHEL ELEMENT
5536-43359-0014 THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWAMS IS ONLY LIMITED BY THE INSTITUTION OF WAR
5536-43359-0015 OUR HONOUR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR YOUR SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP
5536-43359-0016 LOVE BETWEEN MEN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MAYING INSTINCT AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING
5536-43359-0017 BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUTH UNDER ANY IN ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN
5536-43359-0018 THIS SPOND IS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS USUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH
5536-43363-0000 RE INCARNATION AND THE CONVERSIVE SPIRITS
5536-43363-0001 THEREFORE HE CORPSEED DEATH AND BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
5536-43363-0002 THE MEN BLACKEN THEIR FACES AND WIDOWS ARE BEREAVEED PARENTS SOMETIMES DASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS TILL THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD
5536-43363-0003 GIVING THEMSELVES UP HOLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED ABOUT ANY EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE FIRST COMERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS AND THEIR HOME
5536-43363-0004 IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROBES AND FINALLY IN A SECURE COVERING OF ROIDE
5536-43363-0005 AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OR A WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW TETE WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT BESIDE IT NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSED THE SPIRIT COULD USE THE IMPLEMENTS OR EAT THE FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE
5536-43363-0006 IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE A ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS PACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE AND BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH
5536-43363-0007 AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX IN AGE AS THE ONE WHO HAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD
5536-43363-0008 AT THE END OF A YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE RELATIVES MADE A PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTURRED WITH PURPLE CEREMONIES
5536-43363-0009 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED A CULT POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL TESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND OTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE
5536-43363-0010 NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAD BEEN COLORED TO SUIT TO NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROFITS VAKERS AND CONJURS HAD BECOME THE BEST OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD
5536-43363-0011 THIS WAS CARRIED UP TO THE LETTER
5536-43363-0012 THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHECIIES
5536-43363-0013 ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE WRONG RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD
5536-43363-0014 AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
5536-43363-0015 FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM AWFUL SLAUGHTER
5536-43363-0016 THERE ARE MANY TRUST WORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THESE SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS FORETOLD
5536-43363-0017 AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ALICE ON THE ASCINNER BORN RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR A NIGHT CAMP
5536-43363-0018 MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVE THAT ONE MAY BE BORNE MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INCLINATION
5536-43363-0019 THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SU WAR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS BAND
5694-64025-0000 SHALO
5694-64025-0001 THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE AND WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
5694-64025-0002 I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND EXTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNON CAPTURED ET CETERA
5694-64025-0003 ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHLMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED GLADDENS
5694-64025-0004 AS GLAD AND RODE BY US A CURIA RIGHT UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
5694-64025-0005 ON SATURDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
5694-64025-0006 WE WERE SUPPORTING AND ALABAME WERE GAY
5694-64025-0007 THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSE GIVE EM HALE COLUMBIA
5694-64025-0008 THE FAT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS
5694-64025-0009 WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
5694-64025-0010 I HAD HEARD AND RED OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLE FIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF TEN AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
5694-64025-0011 I' HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THEY WANTED TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
5694-64025-0012 OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEN TO KEEP IN LION
5694-64025-0013 ON MONDAY THE TIBE WAS REVERSED
5694-64025-0014 BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONACLES OF LITTLE THINGS IN EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
5694-64025-0015 SHOULD YOU DESIRED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HISTORY
5694-64025-0016 ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HOARSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES
5694-64025-0017 I'M MONDAY MORNING I TOO CAPTURED ME A MULE
5694-64025-0018 IT WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONCEIIT
5694-64025-0019 I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS NECK
5694-64025-0020 MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND OVER TWISTER ON HIS NOSE
5694-64025-0021 SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK ON THE OTHER TO THE CAISSON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER A WHIP UP
5694-64025-0022 THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULES NO AND HE WAS FIRMLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK
5694-64025-0023 ON WHY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LITTLE TOO SMALL
5694-64029-0000 WE REMAINED SEVERAL MILES BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
5694-64029-0001 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATED AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
5694-64029-0002 OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFRISBOROUGH
5694-64029-0003 FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT GRADUATES WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY
