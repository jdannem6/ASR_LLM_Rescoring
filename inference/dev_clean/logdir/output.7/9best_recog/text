6319-275224-0000 WHAT A FUSSIS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON ALL
6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVULOS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROYED OUR ROOTS
6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO EXORTIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE STREET STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY AND TO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
6319-275224-0007 HE REALLY BRIEF TO SEE IT
6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEARFUL THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
6319-275224-0009 INDEED NOT A FLOWER SAVED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACHED
6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOKULOUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
6319-275224-0012 MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH OF FLOWERS
6319-275224-0013 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FUR HOLE
6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATIONS WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELED HER TO THE DIRT
6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARMBOARD TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
6319-275224-0016 BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM SHE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION REIGNED IN THE MONTHS ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
6319-275224-0018 THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND CARRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
6319-275224-0019 IN THIS POSSESSION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
6319-275224-0020 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE OUT EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DUKALIAN AND HE WAS THE SON OF PERMETHEUS
6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PERMETHEUS ON MOUNT COCASES AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
6319-57405-0002 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A CHOICE OF TROUBLE
6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT TO KILLIAN THE SON OF PERMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
6319-57405-0005 THE DAY IS COMING SAID POMTHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
6319-57405-0006 BUT TAKALION AND PERRA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
6319-57405-0007 DOES THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID NAPOLEON TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MURCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEING NO MORE
6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PERRA
6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DECAYING
6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGERLY TO SERVE THEM
6319-64726-0000 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING EAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
6319-64726-0001 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF IN THE LITTLE BABY WHEN AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
6319-64726-0002 THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HEAD WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
6319-64726-0003 IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDUE WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
6319-64726-0004 NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN'S SPINNING BUT SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDITH
6319-64726-0005 SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FANCIED AWAY
6319-64726-0006 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAIT FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
6319-64726-0007 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LEFT THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY GREAT OGOUR WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
6319-64726-0008 THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS BEHELD HIMSELF ON FIRE
6319-64726-0009 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETABLE THICKET OPEN ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
6319-64726-0010 HE ENTERED A LARGE FORECHORD AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND ALL
6319-64726-0011 BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
6319-64726-0012 HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES OF THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
6319-64726-0013 HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS AND STANDING
6319-64726-0014 I HAS WAITED LONGER FOR YOU
6319-64726-0015 THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SENT HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
6319-64726-0016 MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN AWAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENTS AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
6319-64726-0017 THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED IT THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
6319-64726-0018 THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREATER SPLENDOUR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
6319-64726-0019 THE VIOLINS AND HOBOYS PLAYED ALL BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND OMENOR MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS AND THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE
6319-64726-0020 HE TURNED TO SHOW THAT THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD
6345-64257-0000 WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BE ANY AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
6345-64257-0001 AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED A LIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE IN THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IF FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE
6345-64257-0002 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH GENIE UNDESIRRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
6345-64257-0003 SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SCOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE
6345-64257-0004 THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRIME
6345-64257-0005 SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHILE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
6345-64257-0006 IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUTED WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLOURS AND ODORS
6345-64257-0007 BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN SUPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
6345-64257-0008 AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF BOBS
6345-64257-0009 SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDERS AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEED HER
6345-64257-0010 SHE WAS LAST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS
6345-64257-0011 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NOR HER SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
6345-64257-0012 BUT LIVING SOUL THERE SHOULD BE NONE TO MEET
6345-64257-0013 SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND DOWN SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
6345-64257-0014 HE CAME TO HER SIGHED AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING
6345-64257-0015 I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO AKING
6345-64257-0016 THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER STREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY
6345-64257-0017 THE ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST
6345-64257-0018 SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A WRIST OF FUME FROM MY OWN BRAIN
6345-64257-0019 THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAKE CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
6345-64257-0020 WHICH THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
6345-93302-0000 SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PEEM A LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS
6345-93302-0001 HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUE BILLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE AND MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
6345-93302-0002 YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRUST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEAKLY JOURNALS
6345-93302-0003 SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER MEETING IN HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE
6345-93302-0004 AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
6345-93302-0005 SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCPIED TRAVELERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER
6345-93302-0006 THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEM TO HER ALL IMPORTANT
6345-93302-0007 IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
6345-93302-0008 HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD HOPED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION
6345-93302-0009 BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS STILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
6345-93302-0010 THE TAME WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
6345-93302-0011 HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLDS
6345-93302-0012 SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK SHOWER
6345-93302-0013 SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COL IT IS
6345-93302-0014 AND YESTERDAY HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARCY
6345-93302-0015 A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SOMEWHAT THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
6345-93302-0016 WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FELL TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
6345-93302-0017 FOLLOWING THE TINGEL OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
6345-93302-0018 I DON'T WONDER YOU ARE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS' AN IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
6345-93302-0019 THOSE FAR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
6345-93302-0020 COULD'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
6345-93302-0021 DO YOU THINK I'AM NOT SORRY NOW
6345-93302-0022 OH IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US
6345-93302-0023 I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLOWE OVER IT ALL
6345-93302-0024 THEY STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT
6345-93302-0025 IS YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS
6345-93302-0026 THEN HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT
6345-93302-0027 AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK IN REMEDY THAT TERROR
6345-93302-0028 HE CHECKED THE SILL IMPULSE
6345-93302-0029 SO HE LISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
6345-93306-0000 THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED AND TO MEZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPATORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSE MADE AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
6345-93306-0001 THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DESK WAS FALLING IN THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE
6345-93306-0002 THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SKY AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL
6345-93306-0003 BUT AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE
6345-93306-0004 NEVER AT ANY ACT WAS SO IMPOSSIBLE
6345-93306-0005 THERE IS A HEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED
6345-93306-0006 THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED HAD DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES

6345-93306-0009 HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND PRESS IT UPON HER
6345-93306-0010 HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HE HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
6345-93306-0011 IS ONLY THAT YOUR POOR WELL THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED
6345-93306-0012 HER LITTLE FOOT PAPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY

6345-93306-0018 I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEM WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
6345-93306-0019 YOU SEE PAPA SAW VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TOO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED

652-130726-0000 SAN FRANCISCO'S CARE FROM SPIRIT WAS FULLY EXEMPLIFIED BEFORE THE ASHES OF THE GREAT FIRE OF NINETEEN O SIX WERE COLD
652-130726-0001 THOMPSON OPENED A LARGE RESTAURANT IN A FAROL STREET JUST ABOVE PHILMORE AND FOR TWO YEARS OR MORE DID A THRIVING BUSINESS HIS PLACE BEING NOTED FOR ITS GOOD COOKING AND ITS SPLENDID SERVICE
652-130726-0002 ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHILTISON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURN DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DELMONTI IN PAUL STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER
652-130726-0003 HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE KOLOQUEWIAL DEFINITION OF CABARET
652-130726-0004 HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THEATRE HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LIE IN THE WALLS
652-130726-0005 THIS GARVISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF CEILING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ABODE OF SATURNALIA BUT DECORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS

652-130726-0014 IT IS CHANGED FROM WHAT IT WAS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO DIINE
652-130726-0015 IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TOO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT
652-130726-0016 THE FLY TRAP AND CHARLEY'S FASHION THE FIRST ENSUDER STREET NEAR CURANING AND THE OTHER IN MARKET NEAR SOTTER SERVE WELL COOKED FOODS ESPECIALLY SOUP SALADS AND FISH
652-130726-0017 OF COURSE THESE ARE NOT THE ENTIRE MEN USE BUT OF ALL THE WELL PREPARED DISHEES THESE ARE THEIR BEST

652-130726-0022 BUT IF YOU REALLY LOVE GOOD MUSIC MUSIC THAT HAS MELODY AND RHYTHM AND SOOTHING CADENCES GO TO THE TIDLEBER AGAIN AND LISTEN TO THE CONCERT WHICH IS A FEATURE OF THE PLACE EVERY EVENING

652-130726-0034 UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE BABYLONY IS TOUGH AND UNALATABLE BUT AFTER THE DEAF MANIPULATION OF HERBERT THEY ARE TENDER AND MAKE A FINE DISH EITHER FRIED AS CHATTER OR ALL A NEWBERG
652-130726-0035 IN ADDITION TO ABOLONIES THE HOSTILE MAKES A SPECIALTY OF A LITTLE OREGAN PROFISH
652-130737-0000 NEVER DRINK ANY HARD LIQUORS SUCH AS WHISKEY BRANDY GIN OR COCK TALES WITH OYSTERS OR CLAMS AS IT IS LIABLE TO UPSET YOU FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING

777-126732-0002 BUT BEST THEY CAN ONLY INTERPRET THE MIND OF THE PROPHET AND CAN HAVE NO OBJECT OF VALUE
777-126732-0003 MY PALACE THE TICKET OF LEAP APOSTLE WAS SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE A VOICE THAT WEEZED AS IF DEADDENED AND OPPRESSED BY THE LAYER OF FAT ON HIS CHEST
777-126732-0004 AND EVER SINCE HE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO GET HIS WAIT DOWN AS MUCH AS ADVANCE
777-126732-0005 WITH HIS ELBOW PRESENTING NO APPEARANCE OF A JOINT BUT MORE LIKE A BEND THAN A DUMBBY'S LIMB THROWN OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR HE LEANED FORWARD SLIGHTLY OVER HIS SHORT AND ENORMOUS THIGHS TO SPIT INTO THE GREAT
777-126732-0006 YES I HAD THE TIME I THINK THINGS OUT A LITTLE HE ADDED WITHOUT EMPHASIS
777-126732-0007 WHEN HE ROSE PAINFULLY THE THRUSTING FORWARD OF A SKINNY GROPING HAND DE FORMED BY GOUTY SWELLINGS SUGGESTED THE EFFORT OF A MORBID MURDERER SUMMONING ALL HIS REMAINING STRENGTH FOR A LAST STAB
777-126732-0008 HIS INUNCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO A STRANGER
777-126732-0009 THE OLD TERRACE TURNED SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON HIS SKINNEY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE
777-126732-0010 AND I COULD NEVER GET AS MANY AS THREE SUCH MENS TOGETHER
777-126732-0011 THE POSITIONS OF PROPERTY HAD NOT ONLY TO FACE THEIR AWAKEN MILITARY IT BUT THEY HAD ALSO TO FIND AMONGST THEMSELVES YES
777-126732-0012 STRUGGLE WARFARE WAS THE CONDITIONS OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP IT WAS FATAL
777-126732-0013 AH HE DID NOT DEPEND UPON EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT TO KEEP UP HIS BELIEF AND DICLAMATIONS NO ANGER NO VISIONS OF BLOOD RED FLAGS WAVING OR METAPHORICAL LORD SONS OF VENGEANCE RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON OF A DOOME SOCIETY NOT HE
777-126732-0014 DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN THE OBPTIMIST I AM I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND IN FIFTEEN YEARS SOME MEANS TO CUT MY THROAT
777-126732-0015 A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMRADE GOSSIP AND CUT THE TIRADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND HE BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXULTED EYES

777-126732-0021 FOR HIM THE CRIMINAL IS THE PRISONER SIMPLE IS IT KNOT
777-126732-0022 THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS POSTRATION
777-126732-0023 THE FAMOUS CHARACTERISTIC HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE
777-126732-0024 THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DAILY DRUG IN AN OLD VILE OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME
777-126732-0025 THE CALLUS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS BLUE LIPS HIS PASTTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASSENT

777-126732-0028 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BECAME TO STAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT AND TIMIDED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES AND THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH THE BLIND STARE AS IF GOT IT ONLY BY THE SOUND
777-126732-0029 HE GAVE THE DISCUSSION UP WITH A SLIGHT SHRU UNDER THE SHOULDERS
777-126732-0030 STUDY ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM
777-126732-0031 THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND WHO REMAINED STARRING AT THE OLD TOURIST AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN

777-126732-0035 HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE AT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO RUN AT THIS TIME
777-126732-0036 THE COALS AND THE GREAT SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND THE PALACE THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF A PETITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY
777-126732-0037 THE DISDAINFUL PAT OF COMMENT OSIPIN'S THICK LIPS EXCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE
777-126732-0038 HE PAUSED AND ANSWERED WITH A MODEST FIRMNESS
777-126732-0039 I WOULD CALL IT CANABOLISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS
777-126732-0040 THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREEK ON THE QUIVERING FLESH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE
777-126732-0041 STEPHEN SWORE THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR
777-126732-0042 HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED THE KEYS SHOT THE BOLT
777-126732-0043 SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIENDS
777-126732-0044 WITH THE INSIGHT OF AKINRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT

777-126732-0047 NOTHING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER LADDAMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR
777-126732-0048 THESE WERE BUT A FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED THIS SHOPY TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE
777-126732-0049 THEIR SURVEY WAS UNFAVORABLE
777-126732-0050 HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STUDIO WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS
777-126732-0051 HE LOOKED DEEPIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
777-126732-0052 MISTER VIRLOKE PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO DAVY
777-126732-0053 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN VIOLENCE
777-126732-0054 HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING HE MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN
777-126732-0055 STEEPY PROWED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE
777-126732-0056 THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOWS SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLATES FOR THE NIGHT

777-126732-0058 THERE IS NO OBSERVATION THAT FAILS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE
777-126732-0059 IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHAPPITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN
777-126732-0060 THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER RELICK BECAUSE HE HAD SATISFIED VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INSIPPIENT FALL
777-126732-0061 THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS A WINDOW PAINT AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD

777-126732-0065 THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT ST V HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
777-126732-0066 THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DAZZLED THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT OBSET HIS POOR HEAD
777-126732-0067 MISTER VALLOCK'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
777-126732-0068 THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALK ABOUT HERE
777-126732-0069 IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WOULD COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID
777-126732-0070 HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRAGING BLOOD WAS THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT
777-126732-0071 MISTER RELUCK WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW
