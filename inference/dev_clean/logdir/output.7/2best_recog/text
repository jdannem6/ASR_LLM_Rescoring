6319-275224-0000 WHAT A FUSS IS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BEAR STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVULUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE PARTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO EXORRIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS AND THE WOODS
6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY AND WHOSE REFINED YEAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
6319-275224-0007 HE REALLY GRAVE TO SEE IT
6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSED THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
6319-275224-0009 INDEED NOT A FLOUR ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS REPROACH
6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOULOUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
6319-275224-0012 MEANWHILE HOW FAIRED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
6319-275224-0013 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FIR POLE
6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE A VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELED HER TO THE DIRT
6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARMWORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
6319-275224-0016 BUT FOR THE SLIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION RAINED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
6319-275224-0018 THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVORITE GARDEN
6319-275224-0019 IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON A SHOULDER
6319-275224-0020 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND DIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DECAYIAN AND HE WAS THE SON OF POMETHEUS
6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PERMETHEUS ON MOUNT COCASES AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES UNDER THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
6319-57405-0002 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY OR NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBERING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT TO KILLION THE SON OF PERMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
6319-57405-0005 THE DAY IS COMING SAID POMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
6319-57405-0006 BUT TOALION AND PERRA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
6319-57405-0007 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASK
6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID JAPAN TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MURCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED KARA
6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID JAPAN
6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO DESERVE THEM
6319-64726-0000 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
6319-64726-0001 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY LAND AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
6319-64726-0002 THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH THE SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
6319-64726-0003 IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDU WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
6319-64726-0004 NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAD AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDITH
6319-64726-0005 SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINT IT AWAY
6319-64726-0006 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT WAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
6319-64726-0007 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY GREAT OGOUR WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
6319-64726-0008 THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELL HIMSELF ON FIRE
6319-64726-0009 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENITABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
6319-64726-0010 HE ENTERED A LARGE FORECORD AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND ALL
6319-64726-0011 BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOUBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
6319-64726-0012 HE ENTERED THE GARDEN ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
6319-64726-0013 HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS ARE STANDING
6319-64726-0014 I HAS WAITED LONG FOR YOU
6319-64726-0015 THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND IT NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
6319-64726-0016 MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE AND THE CASTLE HAD BEEN AWAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
6319-64726-0017 THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
6319-64726-0018 THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOUR BUT HE DID NOT HATE THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
6319-64726-0019 THE VIOLINS AND HOBOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND OMEN ARE MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS AND THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE
6319-64726-0020 HE TURN TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD
6345-64257-0000 WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BE KNEE AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
6345-64257-0001 AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE IN THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IF FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE
6345-64257-0002 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEINGIE UNDESIRRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
6345-64257-0003 SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE
6345-64257-0004 THIS WAS HER DREAM AS MERELY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY
6345-64257-0005 SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE FOR SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
6345-64257-0006 IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT OF WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND ODORS
6345-64257-0007 BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WAS SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
6345-64257-0008 AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TUNES
6345-64257-0009 SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER
6345-64257-0010 SHE WAS LOST LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS
6345-64257-0011 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NO WHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
6345-64257-0012 BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO EAT
6345-64257-0013 SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS IN YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
6345-64257-0014 HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREATING
6345-64257-0015 I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO BAKING
6345-64257-0016 THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAMS AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY
6345-64257-0017 HER OWN LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST
6345-64257-0018 SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST OF FUME FOR MY OWN BRAIN
6345-64257-0019 THUS WAS SHE BORN AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
6345-64257-0020 WHEN THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
6345-93302-0000 SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PALEM A LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS
6345-93302-0001 HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUEBELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE AND MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
6345-93302-0002 YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW TRUST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS
6345-93302-0003 SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALOUD OF HER READING IN HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE
6345-93302-0004 AND SERIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
6345-93302-0005 SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSKY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER
6345-93302-0006 THE SETTING OF THE SCENES SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORTANT
6345-93302-0007 IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANGMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
6345-93302-0008 HE HAD BEEN LATER HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION
6345-93302-0009 BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK AT ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
6345-93302-0010 THE KING WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
6345-93302-0011 HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COAL
6345-93302-0012 SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOW HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR
6345-93302-0013 SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COLPED IT IS
6345-93302-0014 AND YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING
6345-93302-0015 A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER WHO THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
6345-93302-0016 WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAIL TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
6345-93302-0017 FOLLOWING THE TINGLE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP THICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
6345-93302-0018 I DON'T WONDER YOU ARE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WASN'T IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
6345-93302-0019 THOSE FOR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
6345-93302-0020 COULD N'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
6345-93302-0021 DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SO SORRY NOW
6345-93302-0022 NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR THOSE OF US
6345-93302-0023 I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HUM AND GLOWED OVER IT ALL
6345-93302-0024 HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO DO YOU MEAN IT
6345-93302-0025 ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THINK LIKE THIS
6345-93302-0026 AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR THERE WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT
6345-93302-0027 AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT ERROR
6345-93302-0028 HE CHECKED THE CIVIL IMPULSE
6345-93302-0029 SO HE HAD ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
6345-93306-0000 THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED AND TOMAZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPETORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSE MADE AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
6345-93306-0001 THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE
6345-93306-0002 THEN THERE WERE SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL
6345-93306-0003 AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET LEISURE
6345-93306-0004 NEVER AT ANY ACT SEEMS SO IMPOSSIBLE
6345-93306-0005 THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED
6345-93306-0006 THAN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES
6345-93306-0007 LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT
6345-93306-0008 DO DRINK US AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
6345-93306-0009 HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND PRESSED UPON HER
6345-93306-0010 HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE OF THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
6345-93306-0011 IT'S ONLY THAT YOUR POOR OR THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED
6345-93306-0012 HER LITTLE FOOT TPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY
6345-93306-0013 HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BELL AND WENT
6345-93306-0014 SHE SAID AGAIN YOU OUR KIND

6345-93306-0016 LET ME THINK HE SAID HOW GLAD I AM WHAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY
6345-93306-0017 I SHALL WALK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
6345-93306-0018 I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN YOU WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
6345-93306-0019 YOU SEE PAPA SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED
6345-93306-0020 IT WASN'T I WHO SET THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED
6345-93306-0021 WELL THE SAME HE ADDED A RELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LATCH KEY
6345-93306-0022 YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THAN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY
6345-93306-0023 THE LADY IN THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILL VIEW VILLAH BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARM WOMAN
6345-93306-0024 THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BAND YOUR GIRLS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE CELLAR BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE

652-130726-0002 ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHIL TWICEON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURN DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DELMONTI IN POLE STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER
652-130726-0003 HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLOQUEWIAL DEFINITION OF CABARET
652-130726-0004 HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THEATRE HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINED THE WALLS
652-130726-0005 THIS GARISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF SEALING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ABODE OF SATURNALIA BUT DECORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS

652-130726-0015 IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FUTURE AND TO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT

777-126732-0001 AND WHY INDULGENT PROPHETIC FANTASIES
777-126732-0002 AT BEST THEY CAN ONLY INTERPRET THE MIND OF THE PROPHET AND CAN HAVE NO OBJECT OF VALUE
777-126732-0003 MY PALACE THE TICKET OF LEAP APOSTLE WAS SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE A VOICE THAT WEASED AS IF DEADDENED AND OPPRESSED BY THE LAYER OF FAT ON HIS CHEST
777-126732-0004 AND EVER SINCE HE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO GET HIS WAIT DOWN AS MUCH AS ANNOUNCE
777-126732-0005 WITH HIS ELBOW PRESENTING NO APPEARANCE OF A JOINT BUT MORE LIKE A BEND THAN A DUMBY'S LIMB THROWN OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR HE LEANED FORWARD SLIGHTLY OVER HIS SHORT AND ENORMOUS THIGHS TO SPIT INTO THE GRATE
777-126732-0006 YES I HAD THE TIME OF THINK THINGS OUT A LITTLE HE ADDED WITHOUT EMPHASIS
777-126732-0007 WHEN HE ROSE PAINFULLY THE THRUSTING FORWARD OF A SKINNY GROPING HAND FORMED BY GOUTY SWELLINGS SUGGESTED THE EFFORT OF A MORBID MURDERER SUMMONING ALL HIS REMAINING STRENGTH FOR A LAST STAB
777-126732-0008 HIS ANNUCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO A STRANGER
777-126732-0009 THE OLD TERRACE TURN SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON HIS SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE
777-126732-0010 AN I COULD NEVER GET AS MANY AS THREE SUCH MEN TOGETHER
777-126732-0011 THE POSITIONS OF PROPERTY HAD NOT ONLY TO FACE THEIR AWAKEN MILITARY IT BUT THEY HAD ALSO TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES YES

777-126732-0013 AH HE DID NOT DEPEND UPON EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT TO KEEP UP HIS BELIEF AND DECLAMATIONS NO ANGER NO VISIONS OF BLOOD RED FLAGS WAVING OR METAPHORICAL LORD SONS OF VENGEANCE RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON OF A DOOME SOCIETY NOT HE
777-126732-0014 DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN THE OPTIMISTIC I AM I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND IN FIFTEEN YEARS SOME MEANS TO CUT MY THROAT
777-126732-0015 A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMMON GOSSIP AND CUT THE TIRADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND HE BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXHAUSTED EYES
777-126732-0016 ALEXANDER GOSSIPIN GOT UP TALL ON HIS THREAD BARE BLUE SERGE SUIT UNDER THE LOW CEILING SHOOK OFF THE STIFFNESS OF LONG INABILITY AND STROLLED THE WAY INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS TO LOOK OVER STEPHEN'S SHOULDER

777-126732-0021 FOR HIM THE CRIMINAL IS THE PRISONER SIMPLE AS IT NOT
777-126732-0022 THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS POSTURING
777-126732-0023 THE FAMOUS TERRACE HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FIGURE AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE
777-126732-0024 THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DOUBLE DRUG IN AN OLD VILE OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME
777-126732-0025 THE CALLUS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS GLUED LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASSENT

777-126732-0028 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BECAME TO STAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT AND TIMIDED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES AND THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STARE AS IF GOT IT ONLY BY THE SOUND
777-126732-0029 HE GAVE THE DISCUSSION UP WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG ON THE SHOULDERS
777-126732-0030 STEADY ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM
777-126732-0031 THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TOURIST AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN

777-126732-0033 COMRADE OSOGEN'S FACE TWITCHED WITH EXASPERATION
777-126732-0034 I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED MY CALLAS GENTLY
777-126732-0035 HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO WRITE IT THIS TIME
777-126732-0036 THE COALS IN THE GREAT SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND THE PALACE THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY
777-126732-0037 THE DISDAINFUL PAT OF COMMENT OSCIPIN'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE
777-126732-0038 HE PAUSED THEN ADDED WITH A MODEST FIRMNESS
777-126732-0039 I WOULD CALL IT CANNIBALISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS
777-126732-0040 THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREET ON THE QUIVERING FLESH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE
777-126732-0041 STEPHEN SWALLOWED A TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR
777-126732-0042 HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED THE KEY SHUT THE BOLT
777-126732-0043 HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS BROTHERS
777-126732-0044 WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VIDICT

777-126732-0047 NOTHING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS HE KNEW NOT MISTER LADAMIER AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR
777-126732-0048 THESE ARE BUT A FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED THIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE
777-126732-0049 YOUR SERVING WAS UNFAVORABLE
777-126732-0050 HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEDY WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS
777-126732-0051 HE LOOKED DUIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
777-126732-0052 MISTER VIRLOCK PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO DAVY
777-126732-0053 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOUR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE
777-126732-0054 HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING A MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN
777-126732-0055 STICKY PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL ON A CAGE
777-126732-0056 THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIRED AND UP IN SEVERAL PLATES FOR THE NIGHT

777-126732-0058 THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FILLS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE
777-126732-0059 IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN
777-126732-0060 THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER RELICK BECAUSE HE HAD SATISFIED VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL
777-126732-0061 THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDOW PAIN AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD

777-126732-0065 THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STEBY HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
777-126732-0066 THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DUSTLED THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT OBSET HIS POOR HEAD
777-126732-0067 MISTER VIRLOCK'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
777-126732-0068 THAT BOY HERES TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE
777-126732-0069 IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID
777-126732-0070 HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND TRICKING BLOOD WAS THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT
777-126732-0071 MISTER RELIC WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW

777-126732-0081 COMFORTABLE DEER
