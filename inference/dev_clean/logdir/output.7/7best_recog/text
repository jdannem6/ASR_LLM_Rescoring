6313-66129-0034 AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POLM
6313-66129-0035 AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF TALKING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING

6313-76958-0023 GRAND PILE GROPILE

6319-275224-0000 WHAT A FUSSIES MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL FAIR STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVIOUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHTED TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATION IN THE WOODS
6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY IN WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
6319-275224-0007 HE REALLY GRIEVED TO SAY IT
6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVELY CREATURES SUPPOSED THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
6319-275224-0009 INDEED NOT A FLOWER EXCLAIMED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY OBEYED HIS APPROACH
6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOVEULOUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
6319-275224-0012 MEANWHILE HOW FIREED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
6319-275224-0013 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FURPOOL
6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARDATION WAS READY TO DIE A VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELED HER TO THE DIRT
6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER BECAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
6319-275224-0016 BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED THEM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION RAINED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY IN BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
6319-275224-0018 THE SISTERS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
6319-275224-0019 IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLEMAN HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
6319-275224-0020 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TINE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DECAYIAN AND HE WAS THE SON OF PROMMETHEUS
6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PAMETHEUS ON MOUNT COCASES AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES UNDER THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
6319-57405-0002 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT THE SOURCE OF TROUBLE
6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND SOBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT TO CHAALION THE SON OF PERMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
6319-57405-0005 THE DAY IS COMING SAID BOMMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
6319-57405-0006 BUT TAALION AND PERRA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
6319-57405-0007 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOUR WISH HE ASKED
6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID JAPAN TO SEE THIS LANDFUL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MARKERY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PARIS
6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DECAYN
6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO PRESERVE THEM
6319-64726-0000 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING PRIEST A LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
6319-64726-0001 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF IN THE LITTLE BABY WIND AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
6319-64726-0002 THE TURNING OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
6319-64726-0003 IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
6319-64726-0004 NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAD AN HONEST OLD WOMAN'S SPINNING BUT SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDITH
6319-64726-0005 SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FEIGNED IT AWAY
6319-64726-0006 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR THE HUNDRED YEARS
6319-64726-0007 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY GREAT OGOUR WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
6319-64726-0008 THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FOLLOWED HIMSELF ON FIRE
6319-64726-0009 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETIBLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
6319-64726-0010 HE ENTERED A LARGE FOREKORD AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE
6319-64726-0011 BUT THE FEATURES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
6319-64726-0012 HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SAD ASLEEP
6319-64726-0013 HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS ARE STANDING
6319-64726-0014 I HAS WAITED WRONG FOR YOU
6319-64726-0015 THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND YET NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
6319-64726-0016 MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN WICKED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
6319-64726-0017 THE LADIES IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
6319-64726-0018 THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
6319-64726-0019 THE VIOLINS AND HOBOS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND OMENOR MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS AND THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE
6319-64726-0020 HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE AND BEHOLD
6345-64257-0000 WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEMMY AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
6345-64257-0001 AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROW WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE IN THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE
6345-64257-0002 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEINGY UNDESIRRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
6345-64257-0003 SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAPE
6345-64257-0004 THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY
6345-64257-0005 SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
6345-64257-0006 IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT OF WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLOURS AND ODORS
6345-64257-0007 BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN PRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
6345-64257-0008 AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TWOS
6345-64257-0009 SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFTFOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEED HER
6345-64257-0010 SHE WAS LOST LOST IDLELY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS
6345-64257-0011 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NOR WERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
6345-64257-0012 BUT LEAVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET
6345-64257-0013 SHE HAD LOVED HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
6345-64257-0014 HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREENING
6345-64257-0015 I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO FLAKING
6345-64257-0016 THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM IN THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY
6345-64257-0017 HER ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LAST
6345-64257-0018 SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EARS OF A MIST OF FUME FROM MY OWN BRAIN
6345-64257-0019 THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER FEELING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
6345-64257-0020 WHAT THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
6345-93302-0000 SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS
6345-93302-0001 HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUE BROWS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE AND MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
6345-93302-0002 YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW IT TRUST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS
6345-93302-0003 SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALOUD OF HER READING AND HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE
6345-93302-0004 AND COURTEOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
6345-93302-0005 SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY IN THE DINGY DUSKY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER
6345-93302-0006 THE SETTING OF THE SCENE CAME TO HER ALL IMPORTANT
6345-93302-0007 IT WAS BITTERLY COOL BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
6345-93302-0008 HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXCLAMATION
6345-93302-0009 BUT HERE THE ONLY THINK THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
6345-93302-0010 THE GREEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
6345-93302-0011 HER HEADS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD
6345-93302-0012 SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK BOWER
6345-93302-0013 SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COLPT IT IS
6345-93302-0014 AND YESTERDAY HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO TELL YOU DARLING
6345-93302-0015 A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SOAP THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
6345-93302-0016 WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN ACCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
6345-93302-0017 FOLLOWING THE TINGAL OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
6345-93302-0018 I DON'T WONDER YOU ARE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS IN IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
6345-93302-0019 THOSE FULL TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
6345-93302-0020 COULDN'T HELP IT THAT HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
6345-93302-0021 DO YOU THINK I'S NOT SORRY NOW
6345-93302-0022 NAY IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US
6345-93302-0023 I DIDN'T THINK A RECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLOWED OVER IT ALL
6345-93302-0024 HE STOOD UP PRESENTLY DO YOU MEAN IT
6345-93302-0025 ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER BEFORE A THING LIKE THIS
6345-93302-0026 AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR AND WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT
6345-93302-0027 AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK IN REMEDY THAT ARROW
6345-93302-0028 HE CHECKED THE SILY IMPULSE
6345-93302-0029 SO HE HAD ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
6345-93306-0000 THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED AND TRAMEZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPETORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSE MADE AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
6345-93306-0001 THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAXED CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING IN THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE
6345-93306-0002 THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVE
6345-93306-0003 AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIETLY PLEASURE
6345-93306-0004 NEVER AT ANY ACT IS SO IMPOSSIBLE
6345-93306-0005 THERE IS A SEAT IN A GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED
6345-93306-0006 THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED AROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES
6345-93306-0007 LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW WE ARE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT
6345-93306-0008 DO YOU DRINKNESS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
6345-93306-0009 HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND IMPRESSED IT UPON HER
6345-93306-0010 HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS UNAWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
6345-93306-0011 THIS'S ONLY THAT YOUR POOR WELL THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED
6345-93306-0012 HER LITTLE FOOT TAPPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY
6345-93306-0013 HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAY THE BILL AND WENT
6345-93306-0014 SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE HIND

6345-93306-0016 LET ME THINK HE SAID HOW GLAD I AM NOT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY
6345-93306-0017 I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET MYSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
6345-93306-0018 I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT CRANE AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
6345-93306-0019 YOU SEE PAPA SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TOO TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED
6345-93306-0020 IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIDE
6345-93306-0021 ALL THE SAME HE ADDED A RELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LATCHI
6345-93306-0022 YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKING AWAY
6345-93306-0023 THE LADY IN THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILL VIEWVILLE BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARMING WOMAN
6345-93306-0024 THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THINK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BAND YOUR GIRLS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE

652-130726-0003 HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLOQUE WHEELED DEFINITION OF CABARET
652-130726-0004 HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THE THEATRE HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALLS
652-130726-0005 THIS GARISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF CEILING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ABODE OF SATURNALIA BUT TOCORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS

652-130726-0015 IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETOR IS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT

777-126732-0003 MY PALACE THE TICKET OF LEAP APOSTLE WAS SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE A VOICE THAT WEAZED AS IF DEADDENED AND OPPRESSED BY THE LAYER OF FAT ON HIS CHEST
777-126732-0004 AND EVER SINCE HE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO GET HIS WAIT DOWN AS MUCH AS ELSE
777-126732-0005 WITH HIS ELBOW PRESENTING NO APPEARANCE OF A JOINT BUT MORE LIKE A BEND THAN A DUMBY'S LIMB THROWN OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR HE LEANED FORWARD SLIGHTLY OVER HIS SHORT AND ENORMOUS THIGES TO SPIT INTO THE GRATE
777-126732-0006 YES I HAD THE TIME TO THINK THINGS OUT A LITTLE HE ADDED WITHOUT IMPATIENCE
777-126732-0007 WHEN HE ROSE PAINFULLY THE THRUSTING FORD OF A SKINNY GROPING HAND FORMED BY GOUTY SWELLINGS SUGGESTED THE EFFORT OF A MOR BIND MURDERER SUMMONING ALL HIS REMAINING STRENGTH FOR A LAST STAB
777-126732-0008 HIS ASSOCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO A STRANGER
777-126732-0009 THE OLD TERRACE TURNED SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON HIS SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TOSIDE
777-126732-0010 AND I COULD NEVER GET AS MUCH AS THREE SUCH MEN TOGETHER
777-126732-0011 THE POSITIONS OF PROPERTY HAD NOT ONLY TO FACE THEM AWAKEN MILITARY IT BUT THEY HAD ALSO TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES YES

777-126732-0015 A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMRADE GOSSIP AND CUT THE TIRADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND THE BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXHAUSTED EYES
777-126732-0016 ALEXANDER GOSSIPIN GOT UP TALL ON HIS THREAD BARE BLUE SERGE SUIT UNDER THE LOW CEILING SHOOK OFF THE STIFFNESS OF LONG IMOBILITY AND STROLLED THE WAY INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS TO LOOK OVER STEPHEN'S SHOULDER

777-126732-0022 THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS POST DURING
777-126732-0023 THE FAMOUS TERRACE HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE
777-126732-0024 THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DUBLY DRUG IN AN OLD VILE OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME
777-126732-0025 THE CALLUS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS GLOWED LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASSENT

777-126732-0028 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BECAME TO STAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT AND TIMIDED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES AND THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STARE AS IF GUIDE IT ONLY BY THE SOUND

777-126732-0030 STEADY ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWN TO BED WITH HIM
777-126732-0031 THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND WHO REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TOURISTS AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN

777-126732-0034 I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED MY CALLIES GENTLY
777-126732-0035 HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO RIDE AT THIS TIME
777-126732-0036 THE COALS IN THE GREAT SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND THE CALLAS THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY
777-126732-0037 THE DISDAINFUL PATE OF COMMENT OSCIPIN'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE
777-126732-0038 HE PAUSED THAN ADDED WITH A MODEST FIRMNESS
777-126732-0039 I WOULD CALL IT CANIBILISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS
777-126732-0040 THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREED ON THE QUIVERING FLUSH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE
777-126732-0041 STUDIED SWALLOWED THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR
777-126732-0042 THEY CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURN THE KEY SHOT THE BOLT
777-126732-0043 IT WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIENDS
777-126732-0044 WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRID TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT

777-126732-0047 NOTHING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS HE KNEW NOT MISTER LADDAMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN'S PROVIDE FOR
777-126732-0048 THESE WERE BUT OF FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED THIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE
777-126732-0049 THEIR SURVEY WAS UNFAVOURABLE
777-126732-0050 HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEDDY WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS
777-126732-0051 HE LOOKED DUPIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
777-126732-0052 MISTER VERLOCK PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEVIE
777-126732-0053 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOR AND LOOKED UPON THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE
777-126732-0054 HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING IN MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN
777-126732-0055 STICKY PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN THE CAGE
777-126732-0056 THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLACE FOR THE NIGHT

777-126732-0058 THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT SCALES A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE
777-126732-0059 IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNATHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN
777-126732-0060 THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER RELUC BECAUSE HE HAD SATISFIED VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL
777-126732-0061 THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS A WINDOW PAIN AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD

777-126732-0065 THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STE V HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
777-126732-0066 THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND HOUSEHOLD THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD
777-126732-0067 MISTER VERYLOCK'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
777-126732-0068 THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE
777-126732-0069 IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BE AT THE SAME TIME I DID
777-126732-0070 HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND PRICKING BLOOD WAS THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT
777-126732-0071 MISTER RELIC WAS FULLY RESPONSIBLE NOW
777-126732-0072 ASK CARLON HE GROWLED SAVAGELY
