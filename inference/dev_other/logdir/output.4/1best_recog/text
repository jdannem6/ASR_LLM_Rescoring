4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSION APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMON HAD BODED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SOLDIER
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAMON STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM RIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UN MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 ONE HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRITS PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER IN RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOR EVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALTER IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON IN ITS AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 GRACE AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRIES WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO AND PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER IN MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERAL SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOUR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE TO DISPLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBOURING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICE
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO IN EFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY AWAY

4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNA'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED IN HER EYES STARY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PEE HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME
4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PEEP TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S SHE

4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTMAN TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ALL RIGHTS

4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTHAM CRAFTILY
4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BIRTHAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 BILLY MY DEAR

4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED BILLY TO MERELY
4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRIMARILY
4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD LIKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD LIKE HIM TOO IGNIABLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SOLID DIES HE GALLIED WITH THE GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHUMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT ROLE ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WOUNDED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGIONS PARK
4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY A THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FIGHTS INSTRUMENT
4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0007 WHEN YOU LET ME HEAR BROKE HEAVEN SEEMING
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF IF IT IS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THAT JESUS DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THEY
4515-11057-0010 I HOPED HE WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ILY SUPPOSE
4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHAT DOWN I HADN'T COME ACROSS DICKEN FOR A LONG TIME

4515-11057-0014 ASKED IVY COMPASSIONATELY
4515-11057-0015 I AM AFRAID SIR HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IMPART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EAST THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 I BE MINES TAKE A FOAMEST PLACE OF UNC BILLY WOMEN
4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HAVE FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 IS IT SO SERIOUS
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YOUTH RECOVERS HIS SIDE IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 ADD DIFFICULTIES A SOB GRAVE THAT

4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DIE ACHIEVE
4515-11057-0027 THERE WAS SILENCE
4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MIGHT NOT SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN HE FED ME
4515-11057-0030 JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT

4515-11057-0034 HER STORY IN THAT GIRL'S PIPEA HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER REST ON PRONOUNCING OLD CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SUPPOSE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 JOHN LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HOPPER I COULD IN ANY OF IT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO VAGUE DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAIFIABLE WHAT CAN I DO

4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DEVONED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THE SONS AND THE PAINTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF COURSED BY THE ANXIOUS SPEAKS OF HER HEART
4515-11057-0045 HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ADDED
4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE
4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARRY WHAT

4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER
4515-11057-0057 SHE PULLED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY
4515-11057-0058 DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO ANNOUNCE SHE BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
4515-11057-0059 HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILLVILLE
4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHERE YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FOR YOU WHEN YOU WILL MY WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARION AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
4515-11057-0065 EXCEPT JASPER THAT A FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT

4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTENING
4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF
4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARION
4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNSIDITY AS THESE
4515-11057-0077 I'LL DO WISH IT
4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NOT NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 YE'D NOT HAVE SIGHED MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DID COUNT YOU ADVISE ME
4515-11057-0081 IS THAT NONE WAY OF PROVOIDING FOR MY FATHER
4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARION I CAN'T STAND IT
4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU
4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS EMPEROR IVOUR HER BUT MARION TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SOLD THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBING
4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT CAN THEY BE MORE SELFISHNESS
4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FIGHT
4515-11057-0090 AS IF HE WERE PALE TO MY YOU HAPPY
4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID HE LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SIGHT TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW
4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH HE WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY POSSESS PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLE THAN THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT ON A DEMANDS IS THE CARRIAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET HER ENGAGEMENT LOST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT HAVE MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO BE CHILDISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST
4515-11057-0101 JUST THE DELIGHT A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARION YOU COME WORK
4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND I HAVE NO CHARM TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BY SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THAT MARIAN LEFT THE SHOUT OF THE TREE I OPENED HER OF DRILLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO WAS SUFFERING A SYLVIA HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER LIVED VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNIZED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TIMES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT HE WAS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT SURELY YOU NEED NOT FRESH PROOF HOW AWFULLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU'RE THE ARTLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SAKE AND I COULD NOT BE ABLE TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THEY CAME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL WE BOYS ABOUT YOURSELF I BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTS SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITH IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUN POWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LEAST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 A QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTED TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER A MATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO A DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARIER AND THE FOX SOUND VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIARS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LIE DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT COPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE CAPTAIN REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HAND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND CLAWS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WEALTH SOUTHERN OR OUTER HAND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A FALSE ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BREAD BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HAIRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBORO HAM SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHASTEN THEY HOUSE DID PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HALTING THE LEE PARK THE STOKE PLACE THE EDEMBOURG THE SERBITTON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODDAYLE MISSUS G W HILLIARDS MISSUS PRICES AND MISSUS TURNERS
4570-14911-0010 EYES BROWN DARK AZLE OR HAZEL NOT DEEP SET NOR BULGY AND WITH A MILD EXPRESSION
4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHEEK
4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DEW BA
4570-14911-0013 SHOULDERS CLEAN AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING
4570-14911-0014 FOR LEGS QUITE STRAIGHT WHILE UNDER THE DOG OF GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND AND THE BONE
4570-14911-0015 FEET ROUND WELL KNUCKLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED
4570-14911-0016 COAT SMOOTH VARIETY SMOOTH VERY DANCE AND NOT TOO FINE OR SHORT
4570-14911-0017 HEIGHT NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE EACH ETERNAL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAID ATTRIBUTE
4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT
4570-24733-0002 IN ITS NATURE INFINITE
4570-24733-0003 MOST NECESSARILY EXIST
4570-24733-0004 WE HAVE NOW CREDITED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTEING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONCUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS
4570-24733-0005 AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED FOR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THERE FROM
4570-24733-0006 BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE
4570-24733-0007 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN'S CALASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS AS SUNDAY RAM
4570-24733-0008 COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER
4570-56594-0000 SUCH A CORE SUCH A TIME YOU NEVER DID SEE
