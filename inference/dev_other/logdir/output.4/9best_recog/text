4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSION APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION BUT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMON HAD BODED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE WHISTLER
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF ROME STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE EFFECT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM RIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO HIS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 WOMEN HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDESTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SERVICE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WILLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER AND RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOR EVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTANT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALTER IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRIME FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON IN ITS AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 MARY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRES WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO AND PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GAY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER IN MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERAL SAID GRAY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR SUBJECT IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISSUS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISMAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMEND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBOURING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED THAN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HIS VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE WITH THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SOLUTIONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE CLEAR PART OF THE STRANGE SERVICE
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE ASSEMBLIST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMAN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY

4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENS LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD LIKE HIM REACH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULLY FULFILLED
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNIABLE EVEN IN HIS UN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SOLID DIES HE GALLIED WITH THE GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHUMS STEPPED BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT ROUL ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WOUNDED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGIONS PIPE

4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLEST THAN THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OLD WOMAN AND ALL THAT ALL A DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET HER ENGAGEMENT LOSS FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT HAVE MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO BE TROLISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN ARTILLERY MIST
4515-11057-0101 JUST THE DELIGHT OF MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING INTO THE MUSEUM YES
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARION YOU COP WORK
4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND I HAVE NO CHANCE TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BUY SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHOUT OF THE TREE I OPENED HER OF DRILLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO WAS SUFFERING A SOVIIA HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER IS VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNIZED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TIMES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO WAS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YES THAT MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER OF REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT SHOWLY YOU NEED NOT FRESH PROOF HOW AWFULLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU'RE THE HARDLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SAKE AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THEY COME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL WE BOTH BOYS ABOUT YOURSELF I BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INFERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRCICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 THE INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LAW
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LESS WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE MINISTERS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APOLOGY TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER A MATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO A DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT UPON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HAIRIER AND THE FOX FOUND VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LIE DOWN ANY HARD AND FACT RULE AS TO COLOR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT POUPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE CAPTAIN REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HAND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND PLOWS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BELE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WEALTH SOUTHERN OR OUTER HAND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A FALSE ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX PEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BREAD BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HAIRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBORO HAUNT SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPREAD FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHASTEN THEY HOUSE DID PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HALTING THE LEE PARK THE STOKE PLACE THE EDEMBOURG THE SERBITTON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODDAYLE MISSUS G W HILLIARDS MISSUS PRICES AND MISSUS TURNORS

4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FIND IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHEEK
4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLIGHTLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DEW BA
4570-14911-0013 SOLDIERS CLEAN AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING
4570-14911-0014 FOUR LIPS QUITE STRAIGHT WHILE UNDER THE DOG OF GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND AND THE BONE
4570-14911-0015 FEET ROUND WELLNUFFLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED
4570-14911-0016 COAT SMOOTH VARIETY SMOOTH VERY ADVANCE AND NOT TOO FINE OR SHORT
4570-14911-0017 HIDE NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE EACH HONOR AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAD ATTRIBUTE
4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FALL FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT
4570-24733-0002 THAN ITS NATURE INFINITE
4570-24733-0003 MOST NECESSARY EXIST
4570-24733-0004 WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTEING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONCUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST A HYPOTHESIS
4570-24733-0005 AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED FOR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS COUNTRY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEIR FROM
4570-24733-0006 BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME OPPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE
4570-24733-0007 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN'S CALASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS AS SINDI REM
4570-24733-0008 COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MOODS BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER
