4323-13259-0001 AND ALTER HIS IMPASSION APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMON HAD BODED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SOLDER
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMONS STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE ACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARCH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM RIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UN MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WOULD IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 ONE HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH AN BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURVED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELING THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRITS PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER AND RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOR EVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD FLED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND AFTER IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON IN ITS AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 GRAY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRES WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO AND PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GREY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER IN MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERAL SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOIN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOUR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR OBJECTION IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THANK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE TO PLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN THE NEIGHBOURING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A MATTERPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEANING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN IN THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE REAR PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICE
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SYMBOLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE BEGINNINGS JUST RECENTLY

4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BIRTHAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO EAT IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GREAT LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 LILY MY DEAR

4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BIRTRIMARILY
4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENCE LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILLT
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNITABLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SOLID EYES HE GALLIED WITH THE GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHUMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT ROUL ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WOUNDED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGIONS POCKET
4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARION WHO WAS FIGHTS INSTRUMENT
4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARRY IT
4515-11057-0007 WHEN YOU LET ME HEAR O HEAVEN SEEMING
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF IF IT WAS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THAT JESUS DID HE GO OVER THE WAY OUT THEY

4515-11057-0015 I AM AFRAID SON HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE NOTHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS I PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOBLE SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THEN
4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT TWO MORE QUICKLY AT LEAST THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 I BE WANTS TAKE A FOAMEST PLACE OF UNC BILLY WOMEN
4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT IF FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 WAS IT SO SERIOUS
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YOU RECOVERS HIS SIDE IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 ADD DIFFICULTIES A SOLE GRAVE THAT
4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LAID HIS HAND FILED DESPONDENTLY
4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NINE DOUBT I SHALL SOME DIE ACHIEVE

4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER REST ON RENOUNCING OLD CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SUPPOSE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT OF REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 JOINT LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HOPPER I COULD IN ANY OF IT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO VAGUE DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAIVABLE WHAT CAN I DO

4515-11057-0043 BARION COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DEVONED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THE SONS AND THE PAINTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF COURSED BY THE ANXIOUS BANKS OF HER HEART
4515-11057-0045 HE AGAIN ABRUPTLY
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OF TINT THEN ADDED
4515-11057-0047 THERE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE

4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT HIS BEFORE HIM
4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND PERPLEXED
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FOR YOU WHEN YOU WILL MY WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARION AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO IT
4515-11057-0065 ACCEPT JASPER THAT A FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT

4515-11057-0077 ILL DO WISH IT
4515-11057-0078 HERIMATION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NOT NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERY THING FOR HER PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 YE HAD NOT SIGHED MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DID COUNT YOU ADVISE ME

4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS EMBREL IVER HER BUT MARION TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 LEAVING TO FOLLOW HE SOLD THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBING

4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOSS SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH HE WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLE IN THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OLD WOMAN AND ALL THAT ALL A DEMANDS IS THE CARRIAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET HER ENGAGEMENT LOST FOR NUMBER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT HAVE MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO BE CHALISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN ETERNAL MIST
4515-11057-0101 JUST THE DELAY A MOMENT THEY ASKED CALMLY
4515-11057-0102 WERE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARION YOU CAUGHT WORK
4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND I HAVE NO CHILD TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOODBY SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THAT MARION LEFT THE SHOUT OF THE TREE I OPENED HER OF DRILLAH AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO WAS SUFFERING A SOPHIA HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTERS OF VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNIZED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TIMES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST DEFECTION BUT HE WAS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YES NEXT MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER OF REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT SURELY YOU NEED NOT FRESH PROOF HOW ODDLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU'RE THE HARDLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SAKE AND I COULD NOT BE ABLE TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THEY BECAME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL WE BOTHAYS ABOUT YOURSELF I BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERNLINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUN POWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LAUGH
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDNANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FARTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTMENT TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IN MATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO A DESIRE TO AFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HEREIER AND THE FOX SOUND VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FASHION RULE AS TO COLOR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT TAPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE CAPTAIN REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HAND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND SIZE
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEELE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH A WEALTH SOUTHERN OR OUTER HAND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WEALTH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BREAD BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HAIRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBORO HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRIES
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHASTEN THEY HOUSE DID PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HALTING THE LEE PARK THE STOKE PLACE THE EDEMBOURG THE SERBITTON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODDAYLE MISSUS G W HILLIARDS MISSUS PRICES AND MISSUS TURNRS

4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FALL CLOSE TO THE CHEEK
4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DEW BACK
4570-14911-0013 SHOULDERS CLEAN AND SLIGHTLY SOPING
4570-14911-0014 FOUR LEGS QUITE STRAIGHT WHILE UNDER THE DOG OF GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND AND THE BONE
4570-14911-0015 FEET ROUND WELL MUCKLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED
4570-14911-0016 COPE SMOOTH VARIETY SMOOTH VERY DANCE AND NOT TOO FINE OR SHORT
4570-14911-0017 HATE NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE ETERNAL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAID ATTRIBUTE
4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THESE SAD ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT
4570-24733-0002 IN ITS NATURE INDEFINITE
4570-24733-0003 JUST NECESSARILY EXIST
4570-24733-0004 WE HAVE NOW CREDITED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTEING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONCITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS
4570-24733-0005 AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED FOR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEIR FROM
4570-24733-0006 BEAR IN MINE THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE
4570-24733-0007 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN'S CALASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS AS SYNDIC REM
4570-24733-0008 COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MOADS BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER
