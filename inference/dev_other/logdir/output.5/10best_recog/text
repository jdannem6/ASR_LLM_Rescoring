5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE SEVERELY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL BRIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VISTROY HAS COME TO HEARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON

5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NICE SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE PRESENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THAT CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TRUNKS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED IN THE BAY

5849-50873-0017 MEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME MARCH SOON NOR TO READ
5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WERE SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HANDS HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH A SERIOUSNESS OF YOURMISSION

5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GUIDE IS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARYS IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACE ON A TABLE IN TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WHERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATION HEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOW THE FAINT STARLIT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS READILY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOAK BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 FOR I HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACHED ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN THE CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN MOSWORTH THE TRAINED DANCE CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHIRTER
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAINED BANDS WITH CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 COLD OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIED THE ANGEL GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THEIR ASSEMBLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE WHO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVING CONNETICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL SISTERS IN DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HITTING WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS TO CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FROM THE CAESAR OF THE CHARTIVES WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN A ASSEMBLY ROYAL AND SENT A MOST LOYAL AGUS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMERLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE AND COMMITTED FIVE IN THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FORCE UNION OF THE COLONIES FROM MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH IN INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENCE OF EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMEND CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAMS WAR SOON AFTER THE EXPULSION OF ANDREWS
5849-50962-0000 CALLED DIRT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BRIGHAM TO MISTER MENTRY AND SHE IS THE VERY HEAVY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 TO THIS CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROBE OF CABLE
5849-50962-0003 WHAT'S THAT BOARD FOR ASKED BIRD AS HE SAW A BOARD FOLLOWING THE KEY HOLE
5849-50962-0004 THAT'S THE DIRECTIONS SAID HELEN
5849-50962-0005 THEY ARE PRINTED IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE FRUIT TO CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP TO THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BURT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BULLY WILL GO OUT ON A POLLY
5849-50962-0007 THEY WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND LIVED INTO THE BEACH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOSY MISSUS MINTERN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND MAN WERE ALL THERE FLASSY AND FRETTY BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH'S SEASON
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BURNT AND HOW TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIMEDY FOR ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BOY WAS RETURNING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NARROW IT CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMAN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLI CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG RULER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE GUARDS AND A MAN IN THE COURT CUP BANDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND KNELTING WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED THE FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DRAGGED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND AS GEORGE BRINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFETY AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME ANSWER
5849-50962-0020 I GUESS OUR PRAYERS WERE HERED LAST NIGHT
5849-50962-0021 HERE COMED ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED ON SANDS
5849-50962-0022 WHILE I DECLARE WE DID SAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BRIGHAM SAID THE LIE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NELLY'S FATHER AND HOWL'S UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 AND HOW ON HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN LAW
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS AT COSETTE BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLASSY TO TREAD WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THIS DREADFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 AND EVERYBODY IS SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NET TEAM THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROW BOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CROW TOOK A FEVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELIEST SO
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY WHILE GLOWED ON THE SCHUNNER AND WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE CANTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER HOBBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN IN A SIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WHILE I AM A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE BLACKLIN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO HARM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE SHAKEN US A LIKE TIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN A SHEER
5849-50963-0011 NAVY AND EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOP THING TOUR SUGGESTED MAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESSED EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINST FEAST AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE YOU NOW HE TOLD DOTHY AND THEN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NEAN
5849-50964-0002 YOU' ARE QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DOORKING WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DIRKY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS NEW BLACKLAIN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NARROWLY TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE THE THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BYRT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VICATION AND I'M WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED MAN VOCATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FRETTY AND PLUSSY WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NEUTS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNEAKED THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAVE SPENT ALL THE VACATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTER IS GET DRUNK WILL GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FULL IN EPLETIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DARSKI HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS ESTABLISHED TORTURE
6123-59150-0003 SUDDENLY THE LAST OF CRUELTY THE LOST DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SCENES AND DUSTAYSKIES MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL EITHER
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY NEVER ENVELOPE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICTS
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LOST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LOST OF A MORE OR LESS SANGE MAN
6123-59150-0007 GASTASKEY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SOON OF NECLADEL IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THEODIOUS
6123-59150-0009 UN RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN TO TALK AS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OUR IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SOCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LOST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BAYE CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND ATTEND AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK GAME TANED HIS EYES HEAVEN WOODS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOOD FORGIVE ME FOR CROSS'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTAIRSKI OR A NOT MERIT DOES TO ESKY
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANCORENNA O FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIS INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADOR THAT A SPELL THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE HIS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGEONATUS AND ABNORMAL CHARACTER ORTON
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES HIS DICKENS ADVANCE COMMIC GREATISTS
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BEARING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMINE
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE CARAVANS OF THEMSELVES HE BETRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BROMANIAX
6123-59150-0022 SERVED HIM RIGHT SHOUTED MAJOR BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILL HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY SCIENCE HE HAS BECOME A POPULAR ORA
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODONITIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTACHES ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THE ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CART IS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A PENSION PRINCE S ATDOLATA IVANOVNA LIZIDA PROCCOPHIADONSKI OF GLOGRATONSKI A PRINCESS BERLOQUINNSKI VERGLAYA PRINCE MISSAN COLYAPOGAN IPOOLITA DANIA CHISSENKA DANIATSON AND GENERAL IVOKEAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SACRED OF DUSTIER'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MOSTITUTE IN THRILL OF ITS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER NEWBERRY BOLDLY FACEES A DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS TO DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM STUFF ITS WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGUTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN CABIN SAT IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY OTHER CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO NOR
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY HAVE POSSESSED THEY ARE NEITHER LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL AN IMAGINED TRUE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT OF CONTENT OF DOMESTIC IS WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL IS AT BATTLES A DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOCAYSKI A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GUARD THAN THE TABLES
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DUSTYSKI IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PATUS LORD I BELIEVE HOPE THOU MIGHT UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DUSKY STILL SEIZE THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS BUT PRINCE MISSION IN THE ADIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE COMPLICAT
6123-59150-0041 THE NOBLES ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE IN THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICUNDED VOKEY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LOST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN BEFORE SEATED HER A BENCHION OF POLICE COURT WAITING TRIAL OR AMONG BAG OF ONES HE PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MAKENESS SHOWN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD STAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT'S THE PORTRAIT OF THE MEN ONE SEES BEHIND DLSKI'S NOBLES THE PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOBLES
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FAILURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT BUT TEMPERAMENTED SINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNADEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STOLE
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HAUGHTY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ACTIGULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR ANY IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WATS IN I FOUND HER AT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THEY COULD NOT BE AN UGLY AND MORE PRESAIC AT SEGRATION DAYS CONTAINED IN THE AGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PRISING MOODS IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WEATHER DOMICILE IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME PALM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE HIS STRANGERS SORT THAT KATEERING CARE LOUD SMILES BESPOKE THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CATTERING CARE IS IN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS A LINE OF GOLDEN POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NONE YET LOST THE LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE AND THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR YOUR LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GREGG DIE WHEN AS THE HAIR BELL STRUCK IT SOME YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF THE REPROACHRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LUCK IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE ALL STROKED ITS SONG A DISCOURSE THAT WERE HAD TUMBLED INTO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT RIGHT TO THE PAIN IMPASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER PAUL OFF THE PALM OF HIS WITH THE FAME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARVEY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE MOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE IN THE DUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNINE'S TRAGEDYS
6123-59186-0016 HIS WEALTH IS A PLACE OF OPULANCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED IT FOR AN OWL IS WITH BRANDING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HERBERT'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD LEARNLY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH ECONNIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE POT STILLS LET'S POT ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FEDGOW FRAME AT EVES WITH THRUBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF WHOLLY TO HARRY'S POEMS THE OXEN
