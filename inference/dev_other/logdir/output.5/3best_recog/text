5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS TURN IN MOMENTARILY THE FACT THAT WILL LET HER LOVE TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0060 WHEN THE LUNCH GIRL WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED A DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMAC AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE IN THE NURSE'S SHOULDER

5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STERNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL BRIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICTORY HAS COME TO HEARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON

5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN HEED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THAT CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THE RETURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED

5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT SHE SOON NOR TO READ
5849-50873-0018 THE SON WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HAVE HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY

5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT IS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARYS IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WORE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATION NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOW THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULDN
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOTHED BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 THOUGH I HAVE I CARE HOW YOU APPROACHED ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN THE CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WASWORTH THE TRAIN DANCE CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHIRNAR
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HEARD THE TRAIN BANDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST SILENCE
5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIME GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLS SHOOK THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE WHO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVING CONNECATE WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR AS YOUTHFULNESS IN DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HITTING WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED THE DRESS SPARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FROM THE CAESAR OF THE CHARTIVES WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN A ASSEMBLY ROYAL SENT A MOST LOYAL ADIS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMERLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FOURTH UNION OF THE COLONIES FROM MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH IN INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF ROAD ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENCE OF EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMEND CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAMS WAR SOON AFTER THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BURT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BRIGHAM TO MISTER MANTRY AND SHE IN THE VERY HEAVY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 TO THIS CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROPE OR CABLE

5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BULLY WILL GO OUT ON A POLY
5849-50962-0007 THIS WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN INTO THE BEACH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOSY MISSUS MINTERN NELLY AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND MAN WERE ALL THERE FLASSY AND FRETTY BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH'S SEASON
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BURDEN HALL TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TINY FOR ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BOY WAS RETURNING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMAN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLY CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG RULER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE GIRLS AND A MAN IN THE COURT BOAT BANDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED ROUND AND KNELLING WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FOLLOWING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DREADED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND AS GEORGE BRINGING HIM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME ANSWERED

5849-50963-0002 THE NECK TEAM THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SANDPAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A BEAVER

5849-50963-0006 WE CAN'TED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DREW US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER ROBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN A SIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WHILE I AM A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE CLOCKLAN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS

5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOP THING TOR SUGGESTED MAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTEN THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FEAST AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE YOU NO HE TOLD DORTHY AND THEN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NE

5849-50964-0003 AND DORKING WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DORKEY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLY CALLED MISSUS MC BLACKLAIN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO MARY TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE UP THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BORT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I M WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED MAN THE OCCASION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBSY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FRETTY AND CLASSY WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNEAKED THE CAP
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIRIFICATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTER IS GET DRUNK WILL GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY O FULL IN EPLETIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSESKI HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STINBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS EVERLASTING TORTURE
6123-59150-0003 SUDDENLY THE LAST OF CRUELTY THE LOST DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SCENES AND DUSTAYSK IS MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL ARTHUR
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY NEVER BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LAST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LOST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTASKEY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NECKCLATEL IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THE HIDEOUS
6123-59150-0009 WHAT RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN TO TALK AS ALL ACTIONS MORE THAN OUR IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH A SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LOST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BIG CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND ATTEND AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK GAME TANED HIS EYES HEAVEN WOODS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTAIRSKI OR A NOT MERIT DOES TO ESKI
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ACORENNA O FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHISE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADOR THAT A SPELL THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINAGE OF INTENSITY AND PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGEONATUS AND ABNORMAL CHARACTERALTON
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES HIS DICKENS ADVANCE COMMIC GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUPS AND BEARING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE CARAVANS OF THEMSELVES HE BETRAYED THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIAX
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED MAJOR RESTLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM ILL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DANTES HE HAS BECOME A POPULAR ORA
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATICS EVER PUT OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTACHES ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THE MORE IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CART IS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A PENSION PRINCE S ATDOLATA IVANOVNA LIZIDA PROCCOPHIADONSKI OF GLOGRATONSKI A PRINCESS BERLOQUINNSKI VERGLAYA PRINCE MISSAN COLYAPOGAN IPOOLITA DANIA CHISSENKA DANIA CHISON AND GENERAL IVOGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SACRED OF DUSTIER'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF ITS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MARY BOLDLY FACES A DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS TO DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM THUS ASK ITS WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFATABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MAIN CABIN SAT IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO NORA
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY UNDER LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN IMAGINATION TRUE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT OF CONTENT OF DOMESTIC IS WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL IS AT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTAYSKI A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOLD THAN TO TABLES
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF JUSTICESKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PATUS LORD I BELIEVE HOPE THOU MIGHT UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT GROTESQUEY STILL SEIZED THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS BUT PRINCE MISSION IN THE IDEA
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE KNOCK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE NOBLES WERE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICUNDED VOGAY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT WAITING TRIAL OR AMONG BAG OF ONES HE PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD STAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT'S A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DLSPIA'S NOVELS THE PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOBLES
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPEL'S
6123-59186-0000 HE HAS NOT BUT TEMPERAMENT TO SINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STOOL
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HAUGHTY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ACTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WOODS OR AN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WATS IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THEY COULD NOT BE AN UGLY AND MORE PRESAIC ITS SITUATION THESE CONTAINED IN THE AGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PRISING TRUTHS IN THE CHOICE OF WORLD AS WELL AS AN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE RED DOMICILE IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME CALM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE IS STRANGERS SORT THAT KATEERING CARE LOUD SMILES BESPOKE THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CUTTERING CARE IS IN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS A LINE OF GOLD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NONE YET LOST THE LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE AND THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVER BEAR RELUCTANCE FOR YOUR LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GREGG DIE WHEN AS THE HAIR BELL STRUCK IT SOME YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THEIR HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF THE REPROACHRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASE IS LUCK IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE ALL STROKED ITS SONG A DISCOURSE THAT WERE AT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSATION BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT RIGHT AS TO THE PAIN IMPASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER PAUL AFTER PALM OF HIS WITH THE FAME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HAUGHTY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE MOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE IN THE DUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF CHILD THERE IS IN BROWNIE'S TRAGEDYS
6123-59186-0016 HIS WEALTH IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED IT FOR AN ALLAH IS WITH BRANDING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDA'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BUT HOTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD LEARNLY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH ECONIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE POT STILLS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVES WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF LONELY TO HAUGHTY'S POEMS THE OXEN
