5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGHT SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEEDED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO WAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THAT CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE GROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED

5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET USASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR SIN

5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT IS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES FOR PLACED ON THE TABLE IN TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 BOTH TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATION NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOW THE FAINT STARLOT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOW HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS BOTH BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 THOUGH I HAD A CARE HOW YOU APPROACHED ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN THE CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WASWORTH THE TRAINED FENCE CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHINESE
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HEAR THE TRAIN BANDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 COOL OF YOU HAS THE CHARTAR
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS A BOY CRYING THE ENGLISH GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLES SHOOK THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE WHO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVING CANNETICATE WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL SYSTEM DREAMED THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HITTING WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED THE GRACE STARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FROM THE CAESAR OF THE CHARTIVES WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN A ASSEMBLY ROYAL AND SENT A MOST LOYAL ACTRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMERLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE AND ADMITTED FIVE IN THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FORCE UNION OF THE COLONIES FROM MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH IN INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF ROAD ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENCE OF EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWALTH IS IDENTIFIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAMS WAR SOON AFTER THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BIRT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHONER SAID MISTER BRIGHAM TO MISTER MANTRY AND SHE IS THE VERY HEAVY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 TO THIS COD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROPE OF CABLE
5849-50962-0003 WHAT'S THAT BOARD FOR ASKED BORG AS HE SAW A BOARD FOLLOWING THE KEY HOLE
5849-50962-0004 THEN'S THE DIRECTION SAID HOW
5849-50962-0005 THEY ARE PRINTED IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE GROUP TO CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP TO THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BULLING WILL GO OUT ON A POLY
5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM IT PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND ROOM INTO THE BEACH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS ROBSEY MISSUS LYNDETERN NELLY AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND MAN WERE ALL THERE FLASSY AND FRETTY BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH'S SEASON
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BARTON HOW TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIMEY FOR ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CAVEL SHOWED THAT THE BOY WAS RETURNING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER OR NEARER IT CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMAN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NULLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG RULER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE BIRDS AND A MAN IN THE COURT CUP BANDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NULLING WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED AND FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT LEAVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 IT IS GEORGE BRING HIM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME MASTER

5849-50962-0021 HERE COME ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED ON SAINTS
5849-50962-0022 WHILE I DECLARE WE DID STAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BRIGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING MILLY'S FATHER AND HOUSE UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 AND HOW ON HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN DOWN
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A WONDER THAT WAS AT SUNSET BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLASSY TO FRETTING WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE WONDERFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 AND ANYBODY WAS SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NECK TEAM THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SANDPAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROW BOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FINGER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DE LENAS SO
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY WALL GLOWED ON THE SCHONER AND WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER HOBBSY WHO IS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN IN A SIDE SO THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WHILE I AM A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE A BLOCKLAN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO HARM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFE TIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN A SHEER
5849-50963-0011 NAVY AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOP THING TOR SUGGESTED MAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERK TO MOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE ISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST HASTE AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE YOU NOW YOU TOLD DORTHY AND IN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NEE
5849-50964-0002 YOU'RE QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DORTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DORKING WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDAELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DORCY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC BLACKLAIN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NA HE TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKETH THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BERT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VOCATION AND I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED NED THE PATIENT WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBSY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FRETTY AND PLOSSY WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH METS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNEAKED THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIFICATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTER IS GET DRUNK WILL GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FULL IN EPLECTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DARSKI HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINBURG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A EVERLASTING TORTURE
6123-59150-0003 SUDDENLY THE LAST OF CRUELTY THE LOST DESTRUCTION FOR THE DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SCENES IN DUSTAYSK IS MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL ANSWER
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY NEVER BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICTS
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LAST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LOSS OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 GASTASKEY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NECKCLATEL IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THEORIOUS
6123-59150-0009 ON RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN AT TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OUR IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDES NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BADE CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND ATTEND AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK HIM TANED HIS EYES HEAVEN WOODS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTAIRSKI OR A NOT MARRIAGE DOES TO ESKI
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIMEAN PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ACORENNA OF FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIES INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THAT A SPELL THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGEONATUS AND ABNORMAL CHARACTEROTON
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES HIS DICKENS ADVANCE COMMIT GREATESTS
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE CARAVANS OF THEMSELVES HE BETRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BROMANIACS
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED THE MAJOR RESTLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY JUSTINIAN HAS BECOME A POPULAR ORA
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATICS EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DUSTERES ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CART IS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A PENSION PRINCE S ATDOLATA IVANOVNA LIZIDA PROCCOPHIADONSKI OF GLOGRATONSKI A PRINCESS BERLOQUINNSKI VERGLAYA PRINCE MISSAN COLYAPOGAN IPOOLITA DANIA CHISSENKA DANIATSON AND GENERAL IV OGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SACRED OF DUSTIER'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MOSTITUDE AND THRILL OF ITS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MERRY BOLDLY FACES A DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS A DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOES ASK HIS WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGUTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MAIN CABIN SAT IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SORT TO NORA
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY HAVE POSSESSED THEY ONLY LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN IMAGINED SURE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT OF CONTENT OF JUSTICE IS WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL IS AT BATTLES A DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTAYSKI A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOLD THAN THE TABLES
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF STASKI IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PATUS LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MIGHT UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DUST HE STILL SEIZED THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS BUT PRINCEMISSION IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE COMPLIMENT
6123-59150-0041 THE NOBLES ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF HIS MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICUNDED VOGUEY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED HER A BENCH OF POLICE COURT WAITING TRIAL OR AMONG BAG OF ONES HE PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS CHAIN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD STAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT'S THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DLSKI'S NOVELS THE PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOBLES
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPALS
6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT BUT TEMPERAMENTOUS SINGNA
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HAUGHTY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY OUTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR AN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THEY COULD NOT BE AN UGLY AND MORE PRESAIC AT SEGURATION THESE CONTAINED IN THE AGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PRISING TRADES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WHERE DOMICILE IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME PALM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE IS STRANGES SORT THAT KATETERING CARE LOUD SMILES BESPOKE THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 KATERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS THE LINE OF GOOD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NONE YET LOST LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE AND THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR YOUR LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GREGG DIE WHEN AS THE HAIR BELL STRUCK IT SOME YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THEIR HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF THE POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASE IS LUCK IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE ALL STROKED ITS SONG A DISCOURSE THAT WERE HAD TUMBLED INTO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT RIGHTTUS TO THE PAIN IMPASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER PAUL OFF TO PALM OF HIS WITH THE FAME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HAUGHTY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE MOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE IN THE DUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNIE'S TRAGICIES
6123-59186-0016 HIS WILL IS A PLACE OF OPULANCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED IT FOR AN ALLAH IS WITH BRAWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARBOUR'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD LONELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH ECONIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE POT STILLS LET'S POT ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRIGILE FRAME AT EVES WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF LONELY TO HARLEY'S POEMS THE OXEN
