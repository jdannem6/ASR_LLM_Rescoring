3660-6517-0000 THE DATE SEEM UNINPORT BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THE OFFICES AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
3660-6517-0001 BOWS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELIST AND BESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOLLING NUMEROUS CASES IN STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZAREETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAGUE CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LAID IN CONDITION WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PURPOSE OF WHAT MADE FOR IT
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF AND INNOCENTEST PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOLEING THEIR LABORATORS THE COOK WERE FITTING AS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 THE MAN'S SPACE SUCH AS IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLER STALLS OF FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIM AND THE SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FIRE

3660-6517-0012 FORRIDGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OTAN HAY FROM MELBORN
3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER AND A GOD IN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS

3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHANGED UP AND THEY HAD GIVEN WHAT SHELTERS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR PIECE AMIDS A LONG PATHETIC WINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENTLY ONE TO TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUASH
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND IS VIEWED TO THE WESTWOOD HEADING US SLIGHTLY

3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF WATER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FAR AM THE ENGINEER BECAME THE CENTER OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 THE WATER GAINS IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK PAID GRAHAM
3660-6517-0030 THE MOUNTAIN OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIP SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNCERTAIN
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIVE IS WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 THE BUILT POMP WAS DEPENDED ON THE MAIN ENGINE

3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THE MO WAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVE BY HIS CHAIN
3663-172005-0000 THE FRANZ HAD TAKEN THIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON A BED OF MOSS
3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE FUN CUT UP HE WAS QUITE COMPELLED TO FRESK ABOUT

3663-172005-0005 HER TIRED LAKES COULD NOT PROPEL THE TIRED BODIX RAPIDLY
3663-172005-0006 THE DOORWAY SAW THE BOAT NEARING HER
3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MEN AT THE DOORS HAD LEANED OVER AND CUT HER
3663-172528-0000 I WAS TORMENTED AT MY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DREAMING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS

3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOW ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
3663-172528-0005 THEY SAID THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR OF THIS
3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STATE AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIND SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITOUS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN

3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO SQUEEZE IT WHICH PROVES YOU I WOULD INVETER IT FOE AND THEN DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ELISEN DURAL WAS THE SON OF POPE CLAMON
3663-172528-0045 MASTER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HE SINKS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBPPED ME OF THE DIES FOR THAT MEADOW
3663-172528-0046 I REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LOURING SCENE ON THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEADOW
3663-172528-0048 NICHOLL AUDRA MONTEL GUUTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENZINE NOT FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER DEFEND ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 HIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOR WE USED OFFERED TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOULING PIECE RAGY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HINT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
3663-172528-0054 I LIVED AT MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I AT MOUNTED WE MAKE HASTE FOR ROME
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AM ASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS ASHAMED YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIESTS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COME AS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF COONIA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN VERY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASHING SAW THE TREE STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE MOON FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF IN DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRAISE WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM BELOVED ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT EM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE RUIN AND SAID TO THE BOATMAN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT THANK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHERS TRAVELLERS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE BROWNIE HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE ROWON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTA
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVORING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASP GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL WAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED A ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A BENDICT OF GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MEAN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOON WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOOK AWAY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT MORNING
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDEING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVER LET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO HAD THE COOLAN A FAIRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BLIND FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MERCILESS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND IAM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECAUSE ME TO BEAR MALICE
3915-57461-0023 REPANT THEREFORE IN ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD MISTAKEN THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TO TORMENTIA
3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND RUB YOU
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FIRST SAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRITS AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MENAGE TO ESCAPE IN HER STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK SPEAK A MURDERERS CONSCIENCE PRAISE UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
3915-98647-0000 EVERYWHERE WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE IN WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY IN ANIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFE GUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THE BESET CHILD LIFE
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULTANT EDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE ARE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN OFF VEHICLE KEPT THE CHARGE STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHERS FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND THEIR USUALLY KEPT SPORT AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVE THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILFUL BALANCER OF FROZEN CONS CAN READ ARIGHT THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE
3915-98647-0007 FOR THE GREATER EVENT OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN IN THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED HIM
3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANISH FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO BASE THE FRONT DOOR
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED IN THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRAACIES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE THE DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN BESIDES WHETHER THE DAYS SAT BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE PRIVATE HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED IN CARPENTERS AND PLASTERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKLLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SIN SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASQUE SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS A STYLE COMMONLY INUSING JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR AROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE ON NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AN PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MORNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR THIS CUSTOM REQUIRED THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL OF THE LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IS IS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK COWBOTINE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE AND THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFING A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FE THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VAGUEANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEETH
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFIN AS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INSENS BURNING BEFORE THE COFFINISTS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED IRREGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT AS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT PERFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORSE FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE AND POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FORCAS ALMA A MAN WHOSE LIFE IS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT RUSHING AND THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING IN THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELIEF FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSIONS STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY ON
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH A GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE POSSESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIGHER A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BREATHED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUET REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SCENT BE BORN TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORM COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVORITE PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDHIST IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TOO BE BORN TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDE OLD THAN A BARREL
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABER SHRYNESS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY
4153-185072-0000 HE DIED AT GUENNESHUR A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP THE GARDEL WHERE I THEN DESIRED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE BRENDA CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS DAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL LOY THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR ALL THE ORDER REPEATED INSTANT EITHER TREATED THEM AND BENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CAPTAIN
4153-185072-0002 REPRODICTED THE POOR MANTIC WORK WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUOUS AND ALLING SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES DISPLAYING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A COURSE BROUGHT MISTER REFLAMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OVER INUAL OF HER AFFECTION
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WAS SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN BUFFESA THAT THE WONPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS OUT AND SEA WISHFUL
4153-185072-0004 MY SON PROMISE RENT WITH THEM WITH ISLAND'S HORSE AND GARRIED THE GOOD
4153-185072-0005 ALLEN ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OFFICERS HAD DONE THEY WERE SWOLLEN NOTIFIED AT TIATRA AND NECKTZ WHO ADDED PRISCILLA AMCY WITH THIS MORE BODY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AN ADDING OR THEN DOCTORS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 BY DINING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME BORNE INTO LEGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SOFTENING CONDITION OR WAS NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEN MADE HIS HOUSES HIMSELF AND THEN BEAT A LAUGHED ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONTPART MARIUS
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GIVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARD DOWN BUT HE FOUND HIS COW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLEASED FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARDOR
4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCORT TO HIS FORMER CAUSE OF SAFETY
4153-185072-0012 HIS BUSSUOES CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE BUT THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER MY PRODUCTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSAT SATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OUT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND FINALLY EASILY LEFT ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST QUESTION FEARING THAT SO OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A POLICE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THAT TIME ALLEN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN A GULF A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A WHOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE'S LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUATE RUMPSHIRE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH THE PORTCHISE
4153-186222-0001 AH WHY ON
4153-186222-0002 BUT HESITATED YOU
4153-186222-0003 THE LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER ESCAPED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRENZY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY DUG I WOULD HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS OR NEW LORD PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE AN OWN

4153-186223-0018 I WERE SAID THE MUD
4153-186223-0019 THE BOY DONE THE WAY BUT IN A MOMENT QUIETED AGAIN
4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN AS JANE'S BROTHER JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LOQUAN LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT BOUR SHORT DISTANCE
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE AN ELISCIUM MONARCH IT IS THIS
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DOCTOR HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM WITH SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING NIGHT THE ASSIGNATION WITH A HORSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE COULD RATHER CONCEIVE SO MUCH TO HOPE A PRIEST SINCE HOSTING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTENED HIM TO THE STERN COUNSEL
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ON LADY KNOWN THAT THIS LORD BURST THE HACIENDA OF GASA DEL CARVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE CORPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE GRAIN AROUND THE DARK MOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOY THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSE HAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM AND ITS COY HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THAT SIDE THAT LEAPED TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE CORPSE HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARDS THE SKY AND MET THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT
