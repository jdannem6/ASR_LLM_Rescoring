3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO SQUEEZE IT WHICH PROVES YOU I WOULD INVETER IT FOAM AND THEN DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ELISIGN DOL WAS THE SON OF POPE CLAMON
3663-172528-0045 MASTER FRANCISCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HE SINKS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBPPED ME OF THE DIES FOR THAT MEADOW
3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LOURING SCENEON THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEADOW
3663-172528-0048 NICHOLL AUDRA MONTEL GUUDO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENZILL NOT FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER PREVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FOLLOWED TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFFERED TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GIVEN
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOULING PEACE RUBY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBAS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
3663-172528-0054 I LIVED AT MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MAKE HASTE FOR WRONG
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BROWN FIGURE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPAS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF COIA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARMY OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FAIRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASHING SAW THE BREEZE STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE ROOM FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF IN DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRAISE WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT AL ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED THE COMFORT HIM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE RAIN AND SAID TO THE BOATMAN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINGS YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RUN AND HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE ROWAN OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTA
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVORING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO MASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL IS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED TO LESSON NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VENDICT OF GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MEAN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWON WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOOK A BABY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING ALL MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STRAIN
3915-57461-0017 AND HEIGHTING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO HAD THE COOLON OF FAIRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BROWN FIGURE TO BUDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLESS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I HAD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND I AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALES
3915-57461-0023 REPENCE THEREFORE IN ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD SUSTAIN THE LIGHT OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN IN NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENTIA
3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROBION
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORE SAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOMEDAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE UNTIL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGE TO ESCAPE AND OR STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUTTERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK SPEECH A MURDEROUS CONSCIENCE PRAISE UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THAT OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY IN ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER WAS A SAFE GUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULTED ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE ARE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN OFF THEA KEPT THE CHARGE STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHERS FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND THERE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVED THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLFUL BALANCOR OF FROZEN KINDS CAN READ ARIGHT THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE
3915-98647-0007 FOR THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHESESES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN IN THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED HIM
3915-98647-0008 NO WHILE MANAGE FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRAACIES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT AS THAT DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN THE BESIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER AS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE CHILD AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED IN CARPENTERS AND PLASTERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKELLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 THEY'LL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS A STYLE COMMONLY INUSING JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE ON NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLY IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MORNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DIS CUSTOM REQUIRED THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL THE LAST SAD MISFORTUNES
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IS IS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK CABOT TIE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE AND THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THEIR ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD CAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE EVACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFIN HAS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INSENS BURNING BEFORE THE COFFINERS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT AS THE FORCE OF CONSERGOTISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMES ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE AND POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FRECOZO A MAN WHOSE LIFE IS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN AS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING AND THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 THROUGH THOSE GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELIEF FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE POSSESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO RECORD THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IN
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH A GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN POSSESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIGHER A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BRIEFED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORN TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORM COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVORITE PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHIST IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TOO BE BORN TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDE OLD THAN A BURIIL
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLETER SHRINENESS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY
4153-185072-0000 HE DIED AT GUENNESHO A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP THE GARDEL WHERE I THEN DESIRED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON PROMISE WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE BRENDA GAVE ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS DAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL LOY THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR ALL THE ORDER REPEATED INSTANT EITHER TREATED HIM AND BENT DOWNS RIVER TO HIS CAPTAIN
4153-185072-0002 REPRODICTED THE POOR MANTIC WORK WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUOUS AND ALLING SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES DISCIPLINE WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A COURSE FOR MISTER DEFLAMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OVER INUAL OF HER AFFECTION
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WAS SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN BUFFESA THAT THE WONPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ODD AND SEA WISHED FOR
4153-185072-0004 MY SON PROMISED WENT WITH THEM WITH ISLAND'S HORSE AND GARRIED THE GOOD
4153-185072-0005 ALLEN ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OFFICERS HAD DONE THEY WERE SWOLLEN NOTIFIED AT NIAGRA AND NECKTAS WHO ADDED PRISCILLA AMCY WITH THIS MORE BODY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND AGON OR THEN DOCTORS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 BY DINING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO LEGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION OR WAS NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEN MADE HIS HOUSES HIMSELF AND THEN BEAT A LAUGH ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONTPART MODEST
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GIVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARD STONE BUT HE FOUND HIS QUAW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLEASED FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARDUL
4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL FIFTHNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCORT TO HIS FORMER CAUSE OF SAFETY
4153-185072-0012 HIS BUSSU WAS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER MY PRODUCTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSAT SATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDER OUT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND FINALLY EASILY LEFT ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST DISCUSSION FEARING THAT SO OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A POLICE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THAT TIME ALLEN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN A GUSE A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A WHOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE'S LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTRAMSHIRE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH THE PORTIZED
4153-186222-0001 AH WHY NOR
4153-186222-0002 BUT POSITIVE
4153-186222-0003 THE LETTERS ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FANCIED AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY DUG I WOULD HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS OR NEW OLD PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ANON
4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE HAS CONTRADICTED LOUISE

4153-186222-0012 MY FAR THAT TEACH IS MUSING AND MOTHER SCORES HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO ON ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT

4153-186223-0020 WHOSE INTEREST IN THIS JANE'S BROTHER JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LOQUAN LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE DIALOGUE CARRY IT ON AT BEAU SHORT DISTANCE
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE AN ELSCIUM MONARCH IT IS THIS
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DOCTOR HIS ONLY DOCTOR OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM WITH SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING KNIGHT THE ASCINATION WITH A HOARSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE COULD WELL CONCEIVE SO MUCH TO HOPE A PEACE SINCE HOSTING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTENED HIM TO THE STERN COUNSEL
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ON LADY KNOWN THAT THIS LORD BEST THE HACIENDA OF GASA DEL CORVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE CORPSE HE DISMOUNTED LET HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE GREEN AROUND THE DARK MOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOY THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSE HAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM AND ITS COY HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THAT SIDE THAT LED TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORAKING THE SHADOW OF THE CORPSE HE COST A GLANCE TOWARDS THE SKY AND MET THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT
4153-61735-0007 THE DRAWING CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFTEN AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL AND EVERYT OF GOOD CITIES APPEAR TO PRODUCE A LIKE EFFECT UPON THE NIGHT ATROLLER OF THE PRAY AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW LEAD DARKENING HIS BRAWL DISAPPEARED
