1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH SHE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPERS WHICH SHE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS A A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN ON NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JEWELD TOGETHER IN HIS AWED A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE FACT
1651-136854-0005 WHERE JOHNSON'S OBVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING PROFESSIONAL
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREBALENCE OF THAT HABITS EGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME

1651-136854-0013 SKULLS FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS COMPELLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY WERE DONE
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY INDUCE COMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY ABUSES INSOLENCE AND ENVY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD AN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIORS NEVER ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EAGLES NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WHITE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVER WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TRUE HOW MANY AGAINST FIVE

1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOMETIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND EXCITEMENT AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES

1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIS YOU TO HOPE THAT SHE MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACTIVE VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU RIGHT DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SON OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENSES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABYLON TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HIS RIGHT IN A LUXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTO WOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS

1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS AT A FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANNOUNCE FOR A MAN ALSO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENCE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HAVE BOTHER THAN TO HERSELF
