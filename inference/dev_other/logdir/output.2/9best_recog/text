1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS PERMANENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH SHE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS A LOSS HOW TO MAKE IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN TO NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMPD TOGETHER IN HIS AWED A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A AFFABLE FACT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S OBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLIABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING DISCIPLINE
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT HABITS NEGLIGMENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING IS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOU THINK AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONOURS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KIND TO PRAISE PURSUE AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCY AND GODHOOD
1651-136854-0012 RENT
1651-136854-0013 CALLS FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS REPELLLLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY WILL TURN
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY IT IS COMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCESS INSOLENCE AND ENVY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TOO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIORSVER ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTERESTED
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE ARE WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 PALPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST FIVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO ROUND IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORAL READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEART
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND EXCIT AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERV THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN YOUTHFUL WISE AND INNOCENT AND THE DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HOLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBID TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIS YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY AFTER VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SODING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIMES SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANK OF STOICISM AS THE SONG OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENSES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRUTIES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABYLON TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IS RIGHT IN THE LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTO WOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS PLAIN CLOTH AND BREAKADE

1686-142278-0003 HAIR WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTANCE HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT TO REFUSE IT IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT ORDER TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIOUS PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BRIEF SUCCESS AND ON THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CATHERINE AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOUL OF BAD OBJECTS OF HIS DISGUISE OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WORLD OF BOTH WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER

1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN WISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT A FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANNOUNCE FOR A MAN OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HAVE BOTHER THAN TO HERSELF

1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STATE FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REALING IN WALKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOUL WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE COOLS IN WHICH HE WAS NOW INVOLVED
