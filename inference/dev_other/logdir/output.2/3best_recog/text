1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS SYSTEM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHEN SHE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH SHE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS A LOSS HOW TO NATIVE IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMPD TOGETHER IN HIS AWED A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE FACT
1651-136854-0005 WHERE AS JOHNSON'S OBVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING VESSEL
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT HABITS EGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING HIS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOU ARE AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONORS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KIND OF PRAISE PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCY AND MADWOOD
1651-136854-0012 RAIN
1651-136854-0013 SCORES FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS IMPELLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY RETURN
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY IS COMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCS INSOLENCE AND ENVY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD AND EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TOO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WAS SUPERIORS EVER ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN WHOSE OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED GUESS EVER WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MAY YOU AGAINST FIVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES ARE GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A ALREADY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GOD AND EXCITED AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN IS FULL WISE AND INNOCENT AND THE DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HOLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBID TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIS YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIMES SHALL REMOVE HER YET FATHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RENT OF STOICISM AS THE SUM OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENSES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRITIES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABYLON TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IS RIGHT IN ALEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTO WOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS PLAIN CLOTH AND BROOKADE
1686-142278-0000 HE IS GONE
1686-142278-0001 NOR WOULD DEEP BLUE SKIES OF CRIMSON AMBITANTS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNMIGHTY CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER IN KEY OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING JOYFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HAIR WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT TO REFUSE IT IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT ORDER TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIOUS PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BASE SUCCESS AND ON THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CATHERINE AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOUL OF BAD OBJECTS OF HIS DISGUISE OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WORLD OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SET HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ON TO HERSELF

1686-142278-0011 MISTER LINCOLN'S HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH A FATHER OFF TO HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANNOUNCE FOR A MAN
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HAVE FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME

1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS US TO RELIGION NOR THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE RIDGE OF SOME NEW HORA

1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STATE FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REAL AND WALKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOUL WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE COALS IN WHICH HE WAS NOW INVOLVED

1686-142278-0038 GOD GIVE ME
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING NO WORDS OF SOFTLY REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HIM BUT A FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAD BED AND WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
