1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY GRALIFIED A MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHAT SHE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH SHE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS A LOSS HOW TO LEAVE IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AND NIGHT UPON MY BED SIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY DOUBLED TOGETHER IN HIS AWED A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE FAT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S OBRIVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS A FOLLOWING SPECIMEN
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVEALENCE OF THAT HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO FROST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOU FOUND AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONORS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KIND OF PHRASE PURSUE AT DIFFERENT PERIODS

1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS REPELD BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY WERE RETURNED
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY IN DOES COMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND ENERGY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD THAN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIORSEVER ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HAS OWN INTEREST
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE AFTER WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW READY AGAINST FIVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORAL READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUIDE AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN WITH FULL WISE AND INNOCENT AND THE DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HOLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENYS YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACTIVE VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHAT TIMES SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANK OF STOICISM AS THE SUM OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENSES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SACRATIES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABYLON TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JACKSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IS RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTO WOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS PLAIN CLOTH AND BARRICADE
1686-142278-0000 HERE WAS GONE

1686-142278-0003 HAIR WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT TO REFUSE IT IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT ORDER TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIOUS PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BRIEF SUCCESS AND ON THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CATHERINE AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SORT OF BAD OBJECTS OF HIS DISEASE OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WORLD OF THOUGHT WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER

1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY HAD SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT A FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MAN
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BE THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENCE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HAVE FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
