6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GATE AMONG THE APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LINE WITH FOUR DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASS EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLMEN OF CATTLE AND THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SIMONLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOW BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMOVOTA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAIGHT HERD FROM THE CAROUS TO GOOD FEED THREE BREAD AND CRUISER TOLD TO BRAND THE CALS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORE DRIVE IN THE SOFT GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE OWN ONES WHO DID GO A FOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AS DISTANCE
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASE WOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILT IN A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WILD GAIT AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A CHIEF OF LONG JA H STEP AND IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE PENS SMOKE AT CIGARETTES AND CHATTEN TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SIGNED ACROSS OF ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THEIR REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN THE OLD CAVALCANTI JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE

6841-88291-0013 HOME WRAPPED THE ROBE TWICE WITH THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIDEN LION AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 ANYBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEADS SWINGED FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULLDOGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCS UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLOATED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 BEST THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIVER TOO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS ARE NECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULLDOGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKR HEELED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRAND OPPRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLIGHT
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS A CAT BLAITED A LITTLE LESS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHEERY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUE PELLEN AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWELL TILL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLES ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANING
