6841-88291-0000 THE SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED BEAUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROP BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GATE AMONG THE APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LINE WITH FOUR DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARG MOTIONLESS CANVASS EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF CATTLE AND THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SIMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOW BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMOVOTA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAIGHT HERD FROM THE CAROUS TO GOOD FEED THREE BREAD AND CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE CALS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORE DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS

6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREECE WOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILT ON A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WINE GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 WHEN STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A CHIEF OF LONG J H STEP AND IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE PINS SMOKE WITH CIGARETTES AND CHATTEN TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SIGNED ACROSS AT ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN THE OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOBE SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOME WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE WITH THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STIRP TO AVOID THE TIDEN LION AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 SOMEBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TOSIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULLDOGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCED UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLUSHED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 LEST THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIVER TOO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS SUM NECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HAT IRON YIELD ONE OF THE BULLDOGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKER HE ALLED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRAND OPPRESSED THEIR IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CAT BLEED A LITTLE LESS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUE PEALIN AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TELL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANNAN
