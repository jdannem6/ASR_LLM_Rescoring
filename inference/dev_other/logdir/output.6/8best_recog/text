6841-88291-0000 THE CENTRE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED BEAUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DRAW BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILED IN A GOOD GATE AMONG THE APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LINE WITH FOUR DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARG MOTIONLESS CANVASS EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLMEN OF CATTLE AND THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOW BROUGHT ME THE CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMOVOTA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAIGHT HERD FROM THE CORRALES TO GOOD FEED THREE BREAD AND CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE CALS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SURE DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE OWN ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AS DISTANCE
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASE WOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIRE GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 WHEN STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A CHIEF OF LONG JA H STEP AND IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE PINS SMOKE AND CIGARETTES AND CHATTEN TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SIGNED ACROSS HAD ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN WROTE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOSE SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 WHOM WE WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE WITH THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIGHTEN LION AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID MANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWUNG HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULLDOGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNS UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY PLUCKED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 AS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIVER TOO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON HELLED ONE OF THE BULLDOGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKER HE YELLED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRAND SUPPRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLEATED A LITTLE LESS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHEERY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUE PELLON AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SLOW TELL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLES BROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANNAN
