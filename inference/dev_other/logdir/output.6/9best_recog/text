6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SERVANTS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
6599-38591-0012 THE QUANTITIES PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCES RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ASSESSION
6841-88291-0000 THE SINISTER EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED BEAUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DRAW BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GATE AMONG THE APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LINE WITH FOUR DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARG MOTIONLESS CANVASS EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLMAN OF CATTLE AND THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SIMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOW BROUGHT ME THE CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMOVOTA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAIGHT HERD FROM THE CORRALES TO GOOD FEED THREE BREAD AND CREWS ARE TOLD TO BRAND THE CALS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SOLED GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO A FOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CROWS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AS DISTANCE
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREESE WOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILT ON A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATES AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A CHIEF OF LONG JAGGED STEP AND IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE PINS SMOKE IN CIGARETTES AND CHATTEN TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SIGHTED ACROSS AND ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN A OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOG SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOME WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE WITH THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIDING LION AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CHAF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE ASIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULLDOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCS UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY REFLECTED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THUS THE COF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIVER TOO BROKEN YOU CEASED TO THINK THIS SONECE NECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON HELLED ONE OF THE BULLDOGGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKER HEILED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRAND EXPRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CAT BLAITED A LITTLE LESS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUE PELLING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NIPPED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANNON
