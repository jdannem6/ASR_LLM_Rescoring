6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASE WOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILD IN A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WHITE GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 WHEN STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A CHIEF OF LONG JA AGE STAMP AND IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE PINS SMOKED CIGARETTES AND CHATTEN TOGETHER

6841-88291-0013 HOME WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE WITH THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIGHTEN LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 EVERYBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWUNG IT FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULLDOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNC UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLAPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THEN THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIVER TOO BROKEN YOU CEASED TO THINK THIS SO NECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON HE HELD ONE OF THE BULLDOGGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKER HEALED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRAND PRESSED THEIR IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CAT BLEEDED A LITTLE LESS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRANCH SHOW CHEERY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUE PELLIN AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SMALL TAIL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDELS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANNAN
