700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SWANS WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAM AND THE SLOANS HAD BETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEK SLEPT BY

700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNUE THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER KNOWING
700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE AT THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH
700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE SLAIN ANNE SAID DIANA
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW THAT I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A RED HEADTY LANE MOURNED ANNE
700-122868-0003 AND A LANE WAS A LIVING MAID
700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS REPIES SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR CHAT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARN TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOM DOORY MISTER BERRY KEPT PRODUCT SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS THE ANXIETY THAT THEY DRAMATISE A LANE
700-122868-0007 THIS DAY SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC IN THE PRESENT
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING ALAIN
700-122868-0009 THE BLACKFELL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPED IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE IT IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 JANUARY VANCHES
700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FRAILIN TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
700-122868-0013 JANE RAISED TO THE OCCASION
700-122868-0014 THAT BEHIND THE LANDING
700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREEN WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 HERE IS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK RICH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYER
700-122868-0018 THE FLAT STRETCHED UNDER THE BREADS AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JAMES AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY IT IS SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MADE
700-122868-0021 WHY DID SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MEN OF GRIM POSSIBILITIES TO HER
700-122868-0023 ANNE SURELEY
700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH TO JEW IT UP THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE IFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND
700-122868-0027 ASKED GULBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING A LANE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUE AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELA AND THE BARGE AND IN THE FUN
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT IN HESITATED
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEECH
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AN ELDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WIT ALAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GOBER BLYTH AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
700-122868-0033 ALL NIGHT
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SURELY I DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLE BUT STILL
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY TEARS FRIENDS INTO ESCAPE
700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVE MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PER CENTAMENTS ARE APT TO DO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROW MARILLA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T STAY HOW SAID MARILLA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING THE STAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS UP TO SECURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLEXING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IT'S A PHILICATOS SAYNESSY TEMPERAT PREMATE EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SOCRITY SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND A CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL MATRIDORE SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE'S SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVED FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AN EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THE SHARP VVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURBED OUR NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WAIT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAIN WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR FAMILIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LESS IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME HOARSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE HELLS OF A LONG PEACE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS BAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSED TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONOR'S DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH THAT NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET BEASTS BLOOD STAYING THE IN PHILIPSARINA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND COULD DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO IN SO MUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THEY VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
7601-175351-0000 BECOMING OF REVOLT
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS QUITE ON BOARD THE FORWARD
7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE FIRS EXCLAIMED SOME
7601-175351-0003 WHATWITH ASH DESERTS
7601-175351-0004 AND STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED MORN
7601-175351-0005 DID SHE HEAR ME
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERESS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PEN GLANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED BEN WITHOUT AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHAN'T WHITE THE FARS
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATERS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
7601-175351-0011 A MARVEL WAS HEARD
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WORN WENT DOWN TO HIS HOST
7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VIERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROWL
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BEARING ISLAND AND BEACHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO A GLOMORATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER ALTOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I'M BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WAR
7601-175351-0016 HATTERRESS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS APOGRAPHICAL
7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SHUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING A CUSTOM TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK GROWING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE IS MORE THAN ONE AMONG THE STUSS YOU WOULD LIKE DO AND IMITATE THAT I THINK
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAW BONEY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERES WILL SUCCEED THEN
7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WELL MISTER CLAWBONEY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF SHE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TWO
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING THERES ALSO THE NAME OF GRENAL LAND AND THOUGH HATERUS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRUTTONIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY SUCCIDITIES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HENCE WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING CONGRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO HER GALE A FAVORITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PAIN
7601-291468-0002 THE FULL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROTEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECATED AS USELESS VERMINE ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK MOUNDS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY AND ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHETUMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANS AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YOUR HIS SPOLIIA OPIMA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATITUDE
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR A COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ASSISTED IT MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS WHICH WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WITHERCOCKS THAT STARTED AGAINST THE WIND AND CONFOUNDED AND OTHER WRONG HEADED ALL BEHOLDANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FUNDERS AND SPLICES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN GOD MUST LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAIN STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE A BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE OBSERVITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED TO DOG WITH EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE MEAL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE STRICT
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THERE FOR ALSO TO EXPRESS OBSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BLINDS TO A FLEETING AND MALLUSIVE PHENOMENON
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEEN AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE MATTERS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OBSTINATE OF THE STEAM OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LOOKS IN THE WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SURROUNDED OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXPENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALIZED THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET OF MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GAVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY FOLLOWING I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO AUGHT OR LOT RESCRIBED TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING AN INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUT WAY THEIR REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SAKIS IN GIARDONNO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN THOUGHTS OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE PAST YOU FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO ON IMAGINATION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE HAVE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUND ABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THOUGHT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST SO ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THERE WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SAUSTRUS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF EA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON OR GOING AND COMING IN A RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDIA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRATHEUS AND CRTHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF THE FAMOUS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELLIUS AND TELLIMON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS THERE CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF FRANCES WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PLACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KEEN AIRS LIVED WITH UP SERVICE HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHELSCIO BAY AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDIANS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEEN CHASED BY HAWK AND MANY A SAW THE HAWKS EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FRASES
7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTEST OF THE HEROES OF GREASE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BIT O FOES THE SARRAMAAT I
7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FROM YOU
7641-96670-0013 ERIC'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE QUEEN IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DEVOTED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YOU ARE TRULY OF THE SEAT OF THOSE MORTALS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE BEFORE WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THOSE MAID VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
7641-96670-0020 NO THAT ON THE PLAIN OF VARIOUS YONDER I HAVE TWO FAR BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET TO BRASS
7641-96670-0021 THEN I SAW THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD UP TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF HIS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFIDENTED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS SAVAGES
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES O MEDIA GREW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 FRANKUS AND MOUSE WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUP TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADD MENACES EVER SMILING FACE AND EVERADING BEING
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE IT MADAME SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER A MENDUS HAVING LOVE OF ALCESTUS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND IT MATTERS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME THROUGH HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADVISE A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE NOR APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID NED MENACE
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE ME WITH A FACE I WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE THAT HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMIT HIS
7641-96684-0009 ADMIT US AND MENACE HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM AT MEADOWS AND LET US KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE WORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO IT ADMIT US
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORNER BETWEEN TWO STONES
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SIGN AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEERED AND HER KNEE SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GOETH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORA CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DUSK COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 AT MEDICINE TOOK THE MAN SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE TO THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN AD MENCE WENTING TO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER'S BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF LAND WORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE HOUSE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE QUEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW THE WOODSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 IN THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS I HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FROM HER
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PLACE
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALL CASTIA'S STRONG BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SEARCH CAME FROM HER
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR IT MATTERS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH JOCASTUS SUDDENLY AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THAT EXERCISE DO
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN FOXES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUNDS OF GUARDS THOSE WHOM DESPERATE SOUND INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STARVE WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0031 AND WHEN A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
