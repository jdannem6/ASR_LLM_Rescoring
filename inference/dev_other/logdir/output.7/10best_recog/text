700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A RED HEADEY LANE MOURNED ANNE

700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS ROBEIES SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR CHAT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOM DOORY MISTER BRRY KEPT PRODUCT SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE ZADIG THAT THEY DRAMAATISE A LANE
700-122868-0007 THOSE DAY SHE SAID ARE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING A LAY
700-122868-0009 THE BLACKCHELL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPED IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 IT SMILES THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 JUNE YEAR ANCHES
700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FRAILING TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD

700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 THERE IS ONE CHANCE JUST
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOURY PRAYER
700-122868-0018 THE LATTER DRIFTED UNDER THE BREADS AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THE VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY IS SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MEAN
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE WERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MEN OF COARSE IMPOSSIBILITIES TO HER

700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH TO KEEP IT UP THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS SIMPLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED AUNT
700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS HORSE
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING A LANE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUE AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELA AND THE BARGE ENDING THE FUN
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT AND HESITATION
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEAST
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AN ELDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WIT LAID AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU OF GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
700-122868-0033 ALL I
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNESHIRELY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TOLERABLY BUT STILL
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS IN TWO ESCAPE
700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVE MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMMENTS ARE APT TO DO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SINS ANNE GROWN MARILLA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T SAY HOW SAID PRISCILLA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING THE STAKES AND EACH OF MISTAKE HAS UP TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEIST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IT'S A PHILICATOS SAY MISSY TEMPERAAT PREMENT EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SUCCRITY SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND A CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL MATRIDORE SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE'S SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PETER'S HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AN EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THE SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED THIS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAIN WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR BODIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEARLESS IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE AIRS OF A LONG PIECE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WAS THEN IN HIS PAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIEST ART OF THE GLADIADORS PROPOSED TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONORS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHER'S HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET BEASTS BLOOD STAYING THE INPHOSARINA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM A FIGHT AND A DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO IN SO MUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES MET THEM ON
7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLTS
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE ENTERPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORWARD
7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE BARS EXCLAIMED SOME
7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH ASH DESERTGE
7601-175351-0004 AND STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED HORN
7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR HIM
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATRICS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PEN ADVANCEING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED BEN WITHIN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHA'N'T LIGHT THE FARS
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATRICS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS HARD
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WORREN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VERED AWAY EAST CUTTING A YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROWL
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BEARING ISLAND AND BEACHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO A GLOMORATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACTED DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER COULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I'M BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WARLE
7601-175351-0016 HATERUS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SOUTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS APOCRIPHO
7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN KEPT FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING A CUSTOM TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THE REST OF THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK GRAVITY THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE IS MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US SHE WOULD LIKE DO AND IMITATE THEM I THINK
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAUBONY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATRUS WILL SUCCEED THEN
7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBOEY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF THE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TWO
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBURT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING THERES ALSO THE NAME OF GRENAL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERUS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRATONIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCIDITIES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HENCE WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING CONGRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO OUR GALE A FAVORITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC MEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PRETTIEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLOIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK MOUNDS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY AND ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHETMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGS AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIIA OPIMA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATUOUS
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR A COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ASSISTED IT MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS WHICH WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WITHERCOCKS THAT STARTED AGAINST THE WIND AND CONFOUND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED ALL BEHOLDANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND FOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FOUNDERS AND SPLICES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DRIVER WHO QUIETLY DIES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOG MUST LEAD IT BUT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAIN STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE A BANDAGE FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED TO DOGG WAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WILL IN ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF THIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICT
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES OF ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BELONGS TO A FLEETING AND LUC OF PHENOMENON
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNIZES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND SUBSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LAD IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OBJECT OF THE STEAM OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN THE WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF MANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOY FOR AN YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SURRENDER OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCITRATED UPON ONE
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALZE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET OF MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY FALLING I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO AUGHT OR LOT RESCRIBED TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERR AN INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUT WITH THEIR GUARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SAKIS IN GEORDONNO BRUNNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SILENCE OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE PAST VIEW FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROW OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUND ABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE KEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ELSE WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND MISS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KINGS SAUSTROUS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON OR GOING AND COMING IN A RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDIUM TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRATHEUS AND CRETHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF THE FAMOUS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELLUS AND TELL HIM ON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF FITZIS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WANDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE HOUSE BUILDINGS IN ONE KING NADUS LIVED WITH UP SERVICE HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHELCIO BAY AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDINGS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MANY I SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FROSTUS
7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTEST OF THE SHEOES OF GREECE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BIT O FOES THE SARRAMAT I
7641-96670-0012 HE IF HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
7641-96670-0013 EDITOR'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE CHILD HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE MORTALS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WAS SPEAKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THOSE MEED VERY CHANGED BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
7641-96670-0020 NO THAT ON THE PLAIN OF PARIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FAR BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET TOBRASS
7641-96670-0021 THEN I SHOW THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A GRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD UP TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUND AND CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS SATISFACTIONS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 FRANCES AND MOUSE WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLOS SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADD MENACES EVER SMILING FACE AND EVERRAATING BEING
7641-96684-0002 THOSE BEFORE MEADOWS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER A MEASURES HAVING LOVE OF ALCESTUS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND IT MATTERS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO THEM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMITISE A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE NO APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID NOT MENACE
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLLER STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE I WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE THAT HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMITS
7641-96684-0009 ADMIT US ADMITACE HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY OR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS TO ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM AT MEADOWS AND LET US KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE WORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO IT MEADOWS
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURT YARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SIGN AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEERED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MADITAIRE
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE FOR HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DANCE HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 THAT MEDICINE TOOK THE MAN SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN AD MENDICE WENTING TO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER'S BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF LAND WORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE HOUSE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE CLEAN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOTSTEPS HAPPENED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 IT IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 IN THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THEY HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEAF WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR YE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE HOUSE
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALL CASTHI'S STRONG BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEEDI CAME FROM HER
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR IT MATTERS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH SHALL TESTA'S SUDDENLY AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DO
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN ROC'S FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOUR WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUNDS ARE GUARDS THOSE WHOM DESPERATE SOUND INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRUGGLEE WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0031 AND WANT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
