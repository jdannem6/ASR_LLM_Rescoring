700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN AUNT SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HERSELF TERRIBLY BUT STILL
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO HIS ESCAPE
700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVE MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN FOR PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE AN GROWN MARILLA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T SAY HER SAID MARILLA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING THE STAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS UP TO SECURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORT COMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEIST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLETEING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IT'S A PHILICATOS SAY NISY TEMPERAT PREMATE EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SUCCRITY SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND A CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRADORE SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE'S SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERV THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AN EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THIS SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURBED ON NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLE THIS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAIN WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR FAMILIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LESS IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME COARSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE HEELS OF A LONG PIECE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PEA
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIEST ART OF THE GLADIOTORS PROPOSED TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THEE HONORS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH THAT NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET BEASTS BLOOD STAYING THE INPHOSORINA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND IT DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO IN SO MUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SENT THEM ON
7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF VOTE
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREY ON BOARD THE FORWARD
7601-175351-0002 LAKE THE FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
7601-175351-0003 WHATWITH ASH DESERTERS
7601-175351-0004 AND STUFFED THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WORN
7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERAS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SHUT PEN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PIN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHA'N'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHAN'T WHITE THE FIRES
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTEROUS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
7601-175351-0011 A MOVEMENT WAS HEARD
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WORN WENT DOWN TO HIS POSTS
7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD REARED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROWL
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BEARING ISLAND AND BEACHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO A GLOMORATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER COULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I'M BEGINNING NOT TOO ANSWERED RAWLE
7601-175351-0016 HATTERRUS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SOUTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS A POCRIPHICAL
7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH FORTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THE REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLIPPED AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK CRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE IS MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US YOU WOULD LIKE DOING IMITATE THEM I THINK
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONY THOSE ANIMALS HAD NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERNESS WILL SUCCEED THEN
7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLOBONEY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE WILL HAVE TWO
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING THERES ALSO THE NAME OF GRENAL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERRESS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRATTONIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THEUCIDITIES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HENCE WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING CONGRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO HERGALE A FAVORITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH OF THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE MODEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLWIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK MOUNDS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY AND ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHETOMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGS AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YOUR HIS SPOLIIA OPIMA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATTIC
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR A COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ASSISTED IT MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS WHICH WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WITHERCOCKS THAT STARTED AGAINST THE WIND AND CONFOUNDED AND OTHER WRONG HEADED AND CONTRIVANCES AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLAUNDERS AND SPLICES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DRIVER WHO QUIETLY DIES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOG MUST LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REIGN STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR ON EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS IN CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED TO DOGS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WILL IN ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS OBSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BONDS TO A FLEETING ANDLUSIVE PHENOMENON
7641-96252-0007 YOU RECOGNIZES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER' IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STEAM OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN AN WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOY FOR IN YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SURRENDER OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE REST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALIZE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTANT GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GAVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY FALLING I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO AUGHT OR LAW RESCRIBED TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRD AN INDIVIDUALITY OF MOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTLY THEIR GUARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SAKIS IN GEARDONNO BRUNNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS CORDIALLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN CELLS OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CATASTROPHE FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH HER OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN AS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUND ABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FORS OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME UNTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SAUSTROUS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF VAA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON OR GOING AND COMING IN A RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDIA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TUT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRETHEUS AND CRTHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF THE FAMIS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELLIOUS AND TELL HIMON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHILIPSIS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MISTS LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PLACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KING NADUS LIVED WITH UP SERVICE HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHELCIO BAY AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDINGS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY HOOK AND MANY A SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FROSTIES
7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE SHEOES OF GREASE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BIT OF FOES THE SARRAMAT I
7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WAS SUBDUED THEM FOR YOU
7641-96670-0013 EDWARD'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE CAME IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGEROUS BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEAT OF THOSE MORTALS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR WAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIUMPH YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ANSWERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FLOOR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THOSE MADE VERY CHANGED BY HER CROWN OF GOLD HAIR
7641-96670-0020 NO THAT ON THE PLAIN OF PARIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FAR BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET BREAST
7641-96670-0021 THEN I SHOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMEANOR GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH IN THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD UP TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUND IT CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS SAVAGE DAYS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GIRL WIDE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 FRANCES AND MILLS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SAPPED TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADD MEDICINES EVER SMILING FACE AND EVERRRATING BEING
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE MEADOWS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER A ADDRESS HAVING LOVE OF ALCESTUS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND IT MATTERS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO CAME TO HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMIT MISS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE OR APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID NED MENACE
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLOR STOOD BEFORE ME WITH A FACE I WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE THAT HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADVANCE
7641-96684-0009 ADMIT US OF MENACE HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM THAT MEADOWS AND LET US KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE WORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO MADAME
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD DRAGING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEERED AND HER KNEE SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MADITAIRE
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SMOKED HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DUSK HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 AT MEDICINE TOOK THE MAN SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOTH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN AD MENISE WENTING TO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER'S BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF LANDOR WORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE HOUSE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEMPT TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SOON TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 THIS WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 IN THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT IT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE SEEN FOR HER
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR YOU WILL NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALL CASTU'S STRONG BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
7641-96684-0025 NONE MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR IT MATTERS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH JOCAST'S SUDDENLY AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THY SACRIFICE DO
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN ROCLYES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOUR WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUNDS I GUARDS THOSE WHOM DESPERATE SOUND INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNWORALD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT CONTRIVE WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
