7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THELAND WORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADVICE COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES

7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOTH THIS MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM INTO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT

7697-105815-0008 THEY YOU NEXT SOUGHT MAID COMING TO LAY TO DUSK SO HE SEEMED ME CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS SLOPES LAY FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TUBE WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THOSE AND WEPT LOW THREE BROUGHT ONES CAMPAIGN AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST RAISED FROM THINE SCENES
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTEN GAVE FREE LEAVES FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLAYS AS GOOSE BLAST CROWDS BEST TWO
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT TOM THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VEIL WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS LET'S CALL YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MANEST AND HIPPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN DELAND THE PLAIN GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNTSIGN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 NOR YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR WOULD COME SET TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEVE
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON BEST DOOR FOR LONG YEARS HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAPPENED SILVER YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DIE OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ARTS
7697-105815-0019 S NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON DUE THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HEEL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING ALIVE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP FEW
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HUE AND THOSE WHO CAME BY MADE REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMUROUS SAT THE DESIGN WAS FOR HIM THEY MEANT TO COME BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORTISH SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THEY LAY TO BEATS OF PREYING OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SNAPPED HER OUT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL IN US AND TEAR OUR WINGS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FOUND IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS SPUR THAT HE MIGHT READ IT IN FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FILLED FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FOUND DAWN ON HIS KNEES TO BREATHE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL BE ACT AND THEN WHEN BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 O FOR THAT I AM SAID TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO THEY GAVE WAY TO THE FLASHES TO USE FOR YEASE THAT REST WHICH LORD OF FOR YOU HAD MADE BUT FORT HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LAW OF THE JEWS FOR THEY SEEN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF UGRASSE AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROT WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 SO FAR WHEN I HALF BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE BAY ONCE MORE WHERE FORCE FELL HE SAID DYING WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SET GLANCE AT FOOD OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCREW WHICH HE CAUGHT IT WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BACK HIS ROW
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID ENOUGH IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THINGS TO GOT
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT ACT DID HE NOW CLAMMED THE HUE
7697-105815-0035 HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEATS WRENCHING THE KNOT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MEN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HELP AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAT IS BY STRAND SO SCHOOL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT EAR TO TRY TO FAITH OF THOSE THAT HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE BEAST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THUS STILL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS THEY HEARD THEM ROAR IF THEY DID PAY NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT HOME WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LOT WHERE A WATCHFUL DOUBT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SO WHAT HOUSE OF THIS MEN ARE RUSHED HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HATH COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH HIM TWO HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 TITY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS AS TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU A FOOL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ALL YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 PERSON WAS A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAY SHOULD WISH SO MUCH GO TO MAN THINE
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL GROW WITH SUCH AS NOT THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES A HALF
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY NOR DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HALF ME LEAVING THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TO A BRIEF DAY AND THEN HE SAT AT HIM
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASK WITH WHICH SENTENCED TO SUCH REFUSE AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH GABBET SLEW GANIAH OF DEATH
7697-105815-0052 WHATEST THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WILL SEE MANOUS LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEING HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JUT THOU JEST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STOOP LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YOU SAVE THIS MAN WHO HAST MADE SUCH A STORY NOW AT TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE WHEN ENOUGH HE'S LACKED FOR THE TRUTH THE NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS BATH THE TROUBLE SAME WAY WAS CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HARMFUL SECRETION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO WE SAT OFF THROUGH THE FIEND
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HATE CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GREET THAT I HATH BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IN IS FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 PREACHING WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SET TRYING TO SPARE YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAYKING HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU'D LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FOOT
7697-105817-0011 AND BY BESACT WE CURED OUR SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MEN WOULD HAVE BE MASTER OR MEN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THEY HAVE NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISBADED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SUDDENLY DISAPPROVE BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW WAS GOVERNS AND FEAR WERE THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 CERTAINLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND FATHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAID IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSE SO
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE A OBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROOF TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER AND THIS COME HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THEIR REASON EXCEPT IT FROM THE MASTERSHIP OR GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAIN ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED AT THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECT OF NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN COURT AS IN THE PRESENT DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS A BATHING
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WAS SEEM THAT A SABONISM MAY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD I HAVE A BIT MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FITTING THE STATEMENT SINCE MAN HAD NOT BEEN AND OVERPENS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN ME REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUADITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSATIVE SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HATH BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HATH BEEN STAROW
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUT AT THE DISPARITY
7697-245712-0016 AND A QUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS BOTH DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTIVE NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A MISTAKE OF MEDICINES MAY NOT HAPPY MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF AMAZEMENT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CUT A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN A STATE OF BUSINESS BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF CITIZENS THEY WOULD HAVE BE KNOWN NECESSARY AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED AND FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE SYNIFICENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGUN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAPPEN IN PERFECT IN BODY DISEASE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S COURSE AS IN GENERATION WOULD HAPPEN IN COMMONY WITH MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VANBBRANT IS IN PRISON FORGET I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FROM MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THAT LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE PARTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE OFFENSIVE AND RUBBED STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN LOOK ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STUCK ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUEL TO ME SHE ASKED
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESS IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MEET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU TALKING OF
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VANDBRAT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN NEVER FORGET THE GREATEST MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MIND GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOWLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE SAYING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD TRIED SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MONEY
8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH THE MOCK HUSBAND AND PRISON FOR DEATH
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY GOOD IN SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINNS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 ABOUT AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO CAN DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WHICH SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 NO WHAT OUR MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SLEEP OF IT
8173-294714-0025 I YOED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORDS SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INVATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS IN THATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET WE DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS NOTHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVNEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRACEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAY ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR SENSES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VANBRANT
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAK OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU HESITATING
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR EXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN FRUIT
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A CURIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO EXCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GREAT FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNEER THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 AND THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENSE AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO REVERT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE FANNY A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEN THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN HE REPLIED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BENNET OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF ASSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
8173-294714-0052 WOULD YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY WARRIORS
8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY ONEXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CONSCIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF HER DELICACY TOOK THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER BENNET SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I COULD MODESTLY PROMISE THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE THE COARSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHILE OUR RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BUT BEFORE YOU GO
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY OUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO GIVE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING INTO DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AS SKIRTING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN THAT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLEED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY

8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS WHEN QUITE WILD
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MADDED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS

8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CAUGHT WHOLLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SECRET PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THEY'RE DOGS SAID NORHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS AND THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CAME DOWN BY ITS STREAM

8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDUS AND THOUGH NOT KILL OR ENDURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW GREEN CLOUD OF DUSTS ON THE ROAD

8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT OUR DECORATOR WITH SILKEN GOLD AND SILVER
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WHAT WAS A HOLLOW WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR OF THE CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LIGHT WAS THE RODJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COD SUCKS AND JEWELS THE GRAY DIAMONDS SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN

8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST THAT WERE PARTING HIM ALL ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN EYE SHARP STICK OR GOLD
8254-115543-0026 IS IN IT FINE TWILIGHT DOWN A BIG ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE SONG TALKED IN NOTHING WITH A GREAT REJOINOUS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS A BARGAINING FOR FOOD AND A LITTLE BOOT
8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES KEEPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND HURRY AND FISH AND OFF SORTS OF PUDDINGS AND SUITS
