7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS SIMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THE HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF LAND WORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND MEDICINE COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES

7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES ITS MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUSK FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT

7697-105815-0008 THEY YOUR NEXT SOUGHT MAID COMING TO LAY TO DUST SO HE SEEMED ME CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HE SLOPES SAFE FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TUBE WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THOSE AND WEPT LO THREE BROUGHT ONES CAMPAIGN AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THINE SCENES
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTEN GAVE FREE LEAVES FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE AS THIS BLAST CROWDS BEST TOO
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT HOME THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VEIL WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN THE SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS LET'S CALL YOU AND WHERE DO GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MANEST AND HIPPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN DE LAND THE PLAIN GLORY AND OUR ON OUR WAY TO MOUNTSIGN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 NOR EVEN NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR WOULD COME SET TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEVE
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAPPENED SILVER YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAYS THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ACTS
7697-105815-0019 WAS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON DUTY THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HEEL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS A SPRING ALIVE HE DREAMED OF IT AND THEN WENT UP FEW
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HUGH AND THOSE WHO CAME BY MY REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMUROUS SAT THE DESIGN WAS FOR YOU THEY MEANT TO CLOUD BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORTISH SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THEY LAY TWO BEATS OF PREYING OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SNAPPED HER OUT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL IN US AND TO OUR WINGS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FOUND IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS STROW THAT HE MIGHT READ IT IN FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELL FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FOUND DAWN ON HIS KNEES TO BREATHE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL BEACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 HO FOR THAT I AM SAID TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO THEY GAVE WAY TO THE FLASHES TO USE FOR YEASE THAT REST WHICH LORD OF FOR YOU HAD MADE BUT FORT HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LAW OF THE JEWS FOR THEY SEEN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF DORATCY AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROT WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 SO FAR AND I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAVE COME TO THE BAY ONCE MORE WHERE FORCE FELL HE SAID DYING WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SET GLANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCREW WHICH HE CAUGHT IT WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BY HIS ROBE
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID ENOUGH IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THINGS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIE DAT DID HE NOW CLEAN THE HUE
7697-105815-0035 HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEATS WRENCHING THE KNOT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DART HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MEN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HELP AS IF HE WOULD DO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAT IS BY STRAND SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT EAR TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH LONG
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AN NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS THEY HEARD THEM ROAR IF THEY DID PAY NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEN HE WENT HOME WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LOT WHERE A WATCHFUL DOUBT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SON WHAT HEALTH OF THIS MEN ARE RUSHED HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY QUESTION HATH COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME

7697-105815-0043 HIDY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS AS TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU BEFORE THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ALL YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 PERSON WAS A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT SHE SHOULD ASK IT OF ME

7697-105815-0048 CHARITY KNOW WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HALF ME LEAF THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS TO PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TO A BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SAT AT HIM
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASP WITH WHICH SENTENCED TO SUCH REFUSE AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DABBET SLEW GANIAH OF DEATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WILL SEE MAN WHO'S LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEING HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD OR I NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JUT THOU JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STUPID LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THOSE YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAST MADE SUCH A STORY NOW AT TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE MUST HE'S LACK FOR THE TRUTH THE NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS BATH THE TRIBE OF SAME WAY WAS CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HELPFUL SECRETION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO WE SAT OFF THROUGH THE FIELDS
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HATE CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I BELIEVE THAT I HATH BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR HOUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 PREACHIN WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SET TRYING TO DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAKING HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU'D LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FOUGHT
7697-105817-0011 AND BY BESACK WE CURED OUR CELLS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BE MASTER OR A MAN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS MEN HAVE NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD IT SPADE NOTHING DISBADE HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SUDDENLY DISAPPROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW IS GOVERNS AND FEAR WITH THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 CERTAINLY DIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAID IN IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE A SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OR ON THIS COME HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THEIR REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OR GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAIN ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED IT THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN COURT AS IN THE PRESENT DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS A BAYING
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT ANALYSIS MAY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE A BIT MAN IN THE STATE OF MEDICINES
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FITTING THE STATE OFOM SINCE MAN HAD NOT BEEN AND OVERPENS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MY REASON HAS THE POSITION OF MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUADITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSATIVE SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HATH BEEN STAROW
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUT THE DISPARITY
7697-245712-0016 THE QUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS BOTH DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTIVE NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT A MISTAKE OF MEDICINES MAN WOULD NOT HAPPY MASSED OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT A MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY COT OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CUT A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OFNESS BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF SIMPSONS THEY WOULD HAVE BE NONICIPAL AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IN FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE SIGNIFICENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGUN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAPPEN IN PERFECT IN BODIES SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF MEDICINES THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S COURSE AS IN GENERATION WOULD HAPPEN IN COMMONY WITH MATTER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VANBRAND IS IN PRISON FORGET I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FROM MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HOPELESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO PLAN THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE OFFENSIVE AND WRAPPED STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAT A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANYTHING MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO FREELY TO ME SHE ASKED

8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN NEVER FORGET THE GREAT REFLECTION OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MIND GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL AS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR LIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD CRIED SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MY
8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND AND PRISON FOR DEATH
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FRUIT IN SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE IS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO SEND TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 OH WHAT OUR MEN MADE OF

8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKEN OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS IN THATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVE ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESIRE TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE HER ONLY FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK THE HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAKES ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF THEIR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VANBLET
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEPTHS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU HESITATED
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR EXCIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TROOP
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISONER
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SENSE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEPTH
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE WARWORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTEND AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE ISABELLA A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THOUGH ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEN THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY BUT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT

8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANCH OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BUY MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SOFTLY

8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER VAN BRAND SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I COULD HONESTLY PROMISED THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE TO COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO TILL MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISSING ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GO
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MOVE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
