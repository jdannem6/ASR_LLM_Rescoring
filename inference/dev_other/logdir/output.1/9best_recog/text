116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY THITHER IN THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESSED SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFUL I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLIGHTLY INTO EITHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY ODD
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CAN HAVE THE WORST I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AND IDLE I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPED GOD THEY DID NOT RESIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS UP PROTESTED MY HEART CLAM RAN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NOT I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDLEMAN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE AFTENS A SEA OF LIGHT HE CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTRODUCED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS AN ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 INTRODUCE HIM
116-288045-0015 I WISHED YOU TO MYSELF WHAT BLESSED FOR ME
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNED THE VAN APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HARMER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HUMER THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO IS NOT A IDLE
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GUIDE AND THE SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INSENSE A NUMBER OF MEN AND GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOW AND KNEELING BEFORE THEIR VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND A MEAN OF ALL THIS MY GUY TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT A PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGIVE APOLLO HE SAID WITH HIS SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN VITAL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WOULD A SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND IN ONE ANSWER INTO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WONDER TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 MAY HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEN TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHAEL THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILL WITH WONDER IN MY VOICE QUIVING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JUSTICE AS MUCH OF AN IDLE AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PRESUM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE HALL TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORTAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CAN A DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER LIVE FOR A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH AND EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DAGMA IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILD UP IS IN OTHER CHRISTIAN ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OF PEACE IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 FLASHING TRUTH AND A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF A STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRIINNAL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TAKING WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WHICH TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 THE FIRSTNESS BE IMPERSONAL METHOD'S IRREVERENT BLASSUMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG IN A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM IN B
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOUR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH A SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WHEN IN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST AND MAY BUT THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BUT CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 AMID HIS OFFENCEAL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAZ WERE KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKED QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN EMBORNING DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSELY ENOUGH TO STOP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS NICHOLLSE THE BROOMED HIM MAN WAS SATISFIED AND WHOSE DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED HIS INANQUASY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALISATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN IN INDIA HAS IN REPLACE BY ACTIVE INFORMATION CONCERN THE INDIES
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS A PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS METH
116-288047-0007 THERE IS ANY MAN OF FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS THAT IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES IT BE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURB IN ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RHYTHMLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FEEL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FERRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE ON AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE CUT AT THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET NOT REALLY BECAME TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNDER WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN TILL MAN HAVE MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN AT PEOPLE CREATED SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMME OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FACE AND MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL WAS THE BIRTH PLACE IS SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF A CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATTURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTH PEACEFUL AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS BY REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENT
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WOULD DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COST IN THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR OF HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED WITH A CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF VARIOUS TIMES AS A BIRTH DAY OF JESUS THE GUSS WAS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN EM THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 MIGHT HIS DESCRIPTIONCY IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARIAN JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED TO EGYPT LOOPS HAS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HARD FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH QUICKER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHY IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUSIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VERY FEW OF A YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUALNESS AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAG AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSTERIA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 THAT IN THE ACTIONS OF EVIDENCE ORIGIN OFFERS A FOLLY METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS FYPTICAL SENSEES ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY METHOD AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MIS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE ANOTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW THIS WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDUUS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ACTUALLY NO EVIDENT THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKE A NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYTHTH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY WHAT HE SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES DUCE I'LL KEEP BY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHILE THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME YOU NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 ALAS IS HIS UNANIMOUS SIGNS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE ANNUMEROUS CANADATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOSE
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BUT A SWORD NOW AND BY HELD FAR HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUVES MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VERTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOER MY LEADERS TO CORNERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MYSTERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS BEING ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF TO LIVE PROFESS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 BUT WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH A PREACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS RE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR A GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YOU ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WOULD DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DO HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY IN MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSABLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES CYNISTOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERING US OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEETING OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRIIT AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BUSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FULL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WOOL I HAVE ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS COMPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 BUT THEREAFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSSIBLELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THERE SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WAS SPOKE ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 TWO THREES
1255-138279-0009 FOURTH FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT TO HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED S MORNING
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MUSSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLING SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WELL PULL
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW IT STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THAT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE ACCOMPANY OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLOOD SPOT HIM THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I SAW WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 NOW I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 HOW MUST I IT IS WHAT SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 THEY HAVE MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DUE WE WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO CONSEIL I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO WALK
1255-138279-0024 COULD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS CHANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE DANTES NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED SO THE NIGHT WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH HIM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME TO DAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MAN THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE DID HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 EVEN THEY WILL PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT AT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 POTATOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAD HE LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARDS TO HIS PLANT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LEVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THEN PULLS ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE A MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TROUBLE FROM ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRIES IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF DEATH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOR MASTER AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO MUCH YOUR LEGISATIVE THAN ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER FATE SOME THAT WILL PROBABLY BUY OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GUNS SHALL BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SAID THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HALF FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU READY TO WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE WANT TO BE BURIED IN THAT LAST ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GONE TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I SOON AS YOU DAMNED MY WORSTED STOCKING SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN BE FAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AN ALL I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HAD NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG OUT OF SUCH AN UNTOWORD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE AGREED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD MAY ME WELL I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU MEAN ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK THERE
1255-90407-0006 HEES MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SOVANIA COUNSEL ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS AS A COMPARATIVE OF THE HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIG O ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HAD IT
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL IT MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS COATY ME FROM MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WAS NOT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE DEADS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JUST AFFORDED STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTEBUS TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPITITES
1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUMPTH TIME IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THAT THAT THAT WILL BE AT A HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WILL YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN ELEPHANT STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE OEDIMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE SEATED HER BODILY BY INSERTING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHY HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRING HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR A MISSION LED IT TO THE WITHDRAWER OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS COLD AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SENT YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT ROUGHNOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRAWING HIS PLAY THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME STIPLES FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MATE'S SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S DREAMMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PEASON
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH TO BE INITIATE TO JOIN THE BOOK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WHERE OF THE SATAR
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE LOVE IS CARRO
1255-90413-0000 SHE DREWS PLACE AND SATISFYS
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PYNAVA'S EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FAITHFUL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT A PART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT ONLY
1255-90413-0004 BUT VOUS HELLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GIVE FARTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALLMEATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE DID NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THOUGH WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIDY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SAID UNLESS THEY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE BENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SILKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUSTICE THEY TURN MEDEERRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SAID THIS OLD EER HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTOR AND TWISTED ABOUT EM BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DIDY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH BE NEEDY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SAT IN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE WANINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE YOU BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LADY MEAN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE NODDED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNCIVL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT DEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY HEART AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM WITH LADY TUNNEL CLIFFS ALL THE NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSEPH AND PHISTON
1255-90413-0019 NO DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE EVEN WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JUSTIN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WITTE'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY AREIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAND LIGHT NICKLE UPON AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST TRAVEL
1255-90413-0024 AS HE OF A GUEST STRUCK IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE SANTA EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE AISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JUSTICE LEFT WIFE OF A LAW TO JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUT SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMAN AND WAS CONSENTING HIS SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JUSTLIN TO RECOMMEND HIS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOE REMAINING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENS THE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF LEAVE ENTERS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING ON HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AND IT IS FRESHLY COST A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS A CHIEF THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY A MATERIAL ARE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN THE WEIGHTS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT DISMISSED THE APPARAGES A FORBID IS VERY USED
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR INATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALING THE INVENTION THE SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD KNIT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD OF HER FACTION IF CONCYVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAYED SALUTRY PART INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A HOE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS EXCEPTIONS HAPPENED LEFT FAST
1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGA OF THE ELECTRY ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCONDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF APPARENT ACLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY VOCCAMIS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRENCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGLOSIDIC CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINENING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CURIOUS MANNER THE MONARD OF ELECTRILYING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST HIS SELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL CAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDINGLY FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ATTICON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE MATTERS DAY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY A MONSIEUR THAT ON TO THESE CONDITIONS THE MAUD LINING HUMP IS SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARTLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SORES OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OWN FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PASSED THE RESIDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAPPY CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATTICON LINING COMPASS IN THE LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDIST GROUP
1585-131718-0014 THOUGH ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GASMANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCHIED BUT IT INTERFERRED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HAS LARGE A SOURCE OF INCOME BY ENEMIES
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALL WAS CURIOUS WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ANOMOUS
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NO UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT IS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HAUNTERS OF CITIES THEY LET TRICK AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSHING THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINENCE
1585-131718-0018 A MOST CONSPIIGUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THE NEW YORK SELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WERE AS BLENDY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER AN ISSUES NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GRAY MANY COUNTS WERE READEN AND RAT BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREY BARK AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DIM AND THE BALLAST AND WATERGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WERE SELLED THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY WITH THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TWO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY AFTER IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LAST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH COUNT A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED WHEN OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I THOUGHT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 AT THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORD NICELY
1585-131718-0028 EVIDENTLY IT MAY BE DONE IT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO MEDICINE THAT WHILE HE HAD A FACTORY AT HERISON AND EMPORING THE CHINESE TRADER WHEN TO HIM INCH WANTED A DINAMO TO BE RUN BY HEN POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DINAMMOST ADDISONS SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROSE I WERE SON GO WHERE STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SECMUND BERDMAN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADAMSON UNTELLA FROM THE PARADUSON PHONGRAPHS ANNE WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL IT IS THIS MORE WAY IN A LOFT YOUNG LUSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS A SCIENCE HAS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES ATTERS FIFTY FUSES NUMEROUS OUT OF EAT HOUSE
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE ATASON ELECTURE LIGHT COMPANY LEAST A OD BEESCHALL MARTIAN AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEAD QUARTERS AND SHOW RIMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND HIS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONDR SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS WESTONSHIRE AVENUE TO COME NURSE
1585-131718-0033 THEY EXPERIENCED WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINEER WAS FURTHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WHEN DUG TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOOD EXPLORING A RENT
1585-131718-0035 THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEAR SINCE IF I WAS A VERITABLE BIVE DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY BEING ITS ARDON JACKET OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING THE GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LIKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER AN EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRUS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE OUT WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THAT WAS OUT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MODER
1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER NOTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TO BUSY HER OTHER THINGS TO DETNOTIC
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISAN SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GRAY VIOLINIST WAS RAMINE
1585-131718-0044 WHO WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLLIN
1585-131718-0045 WHY NOT HE CAME WITH HIS FILING ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AS SIXTY FIVE LATE IN NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLETS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HAT OF LONDON FIBRRY GATE
1585-131718-0048 WHO WILL GO OUT AMONG THE FIVE LADIES AND HALF A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLEST STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING HIM MAN STORY IS AT THE HAIR IS IN THEM FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINDER AND HE WHO WAS ALL IN FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAVE NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE CODE
1585-131718-0052 THEN THE GOB BLURRRY SEEMED HOW TO BE SHAPED TO FLORA TO PROCURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF INTEREST AND DISSIPATION AND THE POWERLESS PLEASURE OF FACTING ABSENCE'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON IF GOAT AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MAN ARE MODED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE O STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRAYING ROSE HILL WELL STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICO FASHION AND UTTER THE FALLING ARTORICAL FLOOD
1585-157660-0003 GLARA IS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SOUND A THING THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT THE VASTAGE OF THIS ONE OF HER MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WOLF THAT AND BEAT HIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE HURT AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDING DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVILS HEAVEN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNYED COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WELCOME AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIDE BOTTOMS LAYING IF IN FOAMING ARMS AND MORPHORUS UNTO THE POT OF KNOCK AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIDE OF THE SUN RISINGLAND AT GIFTS GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXHITATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPECTATION BOUGHS AND MOST OFF THERE WERE MOST A PROMISES AND OFF A HEADS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS
1585-157660-0009 DEUCEUS ONE DOUBLE WHEN SIX IS TRIPICALLY
1585-157660-0010 WELL INTO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DELLER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CINNIPOT WHICH WERE IMMEDIATELY KEPT BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOK AT ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 THE PLAY JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE IT WORD FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON THE CAST I WILL STAND A HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF ENGLAND BOO PERHAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JOBED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RCIPROCO
1585-157660-0015 THE PRIMING SHOP OF FOUL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL WAS TABLE AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES ROBYGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORMER WILLING AND BLURRY OUT IN HIS GLOVEMANER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY REASON TRAVELLES IN THE REST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND IN EFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAVING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY HAVE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THE HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE CERTAIN TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT THE MUTILATED MOST CHEERED OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMOTIONAL AND POLITICAL TREADMEN
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLEEVES MUST CHANGE HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS MORES TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BID ITS MORES ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUST FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSE US AS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY DECLARED A TRUE LAUGH OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT APIC OF THE CELL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHAP POWDER GIVES US A UNTOFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FROM OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 THEN THE AGE OF THE BUUDRE CAME HUMANITY WAS CHARRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS ARTEMMO'S DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HOUNDENED INTO AN AGE IF I NOTE CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED IT ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER MIGHT BE NEXT DOUBLE LAW OF EXPLOSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS IT MANY QUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURALLY AND A AND HARM ME WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 MY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GROUP OF AN INALASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HELDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LULLS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A HOMEMAN AND PACIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO BEAR AN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MOSTRING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING US CHIEFS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY INNODO ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HURTING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND A FIGHTING AND FREEDOM CALLS
1630-102884-0016 EACH HAD PRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF THE NOTION WHICH HAS TO A PURERANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUE AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY THOUGH WITH TEN ITS BOUND FREECE AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE PLANTS IN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAG STAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLGONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND JI LIKE MOON

1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TATABLE BEING OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE TREASURE THE JOLTING RIGHT BEING MOVED AND THE CLOBING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 YETTING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK

1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED WITH THE LITTLE EYE CON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE TO KNOW THAT TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND OUGHT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GRAY

1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACH BUT TO PICTURE SUCH MISSISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION
