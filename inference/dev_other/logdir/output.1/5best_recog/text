116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY THITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HEAD EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALION TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLOWLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GARDEN
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CAN NOT THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKING BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPED GOD THAT THEY DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS UP PROTESTED MY HEART CLAM LAY IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO I SAID IN A SLOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDOL BEEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE AFFENS A SEA OF LIGHT HE CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT ENTROMMED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS AUNT WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 REDUC HIM
116-288045-0015 I WISHED WE TO MYSELF WHAT BLESSED FOR ME
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND HELD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNED THE DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT COMER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLO IS NOT AN IDLE
116-288045-0020 HE HAS A GOD AND THE SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INSENSE A NUMBER OF MEN AND GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOW AND KNEELING BEFORE THEIR VARIOUS LINES AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND A MEANING OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT A PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH HIS SUGGESTION OF SEVERIT IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY IN IDLE
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WOULD A SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWER TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WILL TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL HE NOT BE THERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPER'S I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEN TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHAEL THE EMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER IN MY VOICE QUIVING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE USE AS MUCH OF AN IDLE AS APOLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS AS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUE TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TOLLIC IN THE OPEN AND CAN A DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER LIVE OR A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOG MA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CHRISTIAN ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH AND A JAIL GAG IN THE MOUTH OF A STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRIINNAL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS FORWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND STUDY WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WAS TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 THE FIRSTLESS BE IMPERSONAL METHODS IRREVERENT BLASSUMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG IN A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM INPI
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH A SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WHEN IN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST AND MAY BUT THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BUT CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 AMID HIS ASSASSIN EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MINE CRAZ WERE KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASK QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN IMPORTANT DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSING UP TO STOP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS NICHOLAS THE BROOMED HIM MAN WAS SATISFIED AND HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED HIS INANICQUASY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALISATION
116-288047-0004 THE METHOD OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN IN INDIA HAS IN REPLACE BY ACTIVE INFORMATION CONCERN THE HINDUES
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISE OF THE USE TO WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS MEANT
116-288047-0007 THERE IS A MAN OF FACULTY FOR PICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES UP BE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURB IN ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RUINLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FEEL A SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE ON AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE COVERED THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET NOT REALLY BEGAN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNDER WE HAVE REACHED THE EARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN TILL MAN HAD AM MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROAN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES IN FACE AND MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL IS THE BIRTH FACE AS SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGIONS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO A CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTHED PEACE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE YOURSELVES ENTIRELY THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WOULD DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED WITH A CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF VARIOUS TIMES AS A BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GHOST WAS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN O THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 MIGHT IS DESCRIPTION SEE IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARIAN JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED TO EGYPT LUCS HAS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COUNT THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH BITTER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHY IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUSIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VERY FREE OF A YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUAL MONTHS AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAG AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PACAN AUSTAIA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 THAT IN THE ACTIONS OF EVIDENCE ORIGIN OFFERS A FOLLY METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS HYPICAL SENSEES ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MESSAGE AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON ANOTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW HERE WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDICUS AND MERRY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ACTUALLY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXIST IT
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTOR HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MISTH
116-288048-0016 HIM WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN HOW THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD I HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 PALACE IS HIS UNANIMOUS SIGNS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE ANNUMEROUS CANIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE HE IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BUT A SWORD NOW AND BY HELD FAR HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 IF THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JEW'S MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GORE MY LEADERS TO QUARTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLES CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS WHEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF TO LIVE PROFESSOR THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NONE THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH APPROACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS RET TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR A GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YOU ASK SOMETHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT ME JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY PROPERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSABLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES CYNISTOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FROM AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO ITS CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR IMMEDIATE OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRIIT AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BUSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FULL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WOOL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DOLL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONGER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DESIRABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THAT SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WAS TAKEN ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 ONE TWO THREE
1255-138279-0009 FOR FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMARTA
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MOSS OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLING SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WELL POLE
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW HAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 BUT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLOOD SPIT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I LOST WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 THEN I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 HOW MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 YOU HAVE MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO BE WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SIR COURSE I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACTIES I FORGOT TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NINE FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS RANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE BY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NAME WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHALL DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BE BAKED FOR SOME TO DAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER WHICH REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIVATE HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WILL PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT ON HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 POTATOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAD HE LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS PLANT AND RESPECT TO HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LEVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THERE PULLS ASUNDER FOR ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MARRIED IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TROUBLED FROM ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRIES IN FAVOR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BREATH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOR MASTER AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THE MONSTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO MUCH YOUR LEGISATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER FADE SOME THAT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GODS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER IT WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU READY WHICH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE WANT TO BE MARRIED IN THAT LAST ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WORK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 AS SOON AS YOU DAWNED MY WORST STOCKING SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN BOOT HAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AND THOU I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HAD NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGHED OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE COULD
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD MAY ME WHY I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU NAY ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK I
1255-90407-0006 HE HAS MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SOVANIA COUNCIL ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER SAYS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIG ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HAD SUCH
1255-90407-0011 I DIDN'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS COPING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WAS THAT THE EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE NESTS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JUST AFFORDED STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MULTIBUS TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPITENTS
1255-90407-0016 NOW I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUMPETH TIME IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THAT THAT WILL BE IN A HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WILL YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN IRELAND STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ATOMMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE SEATED HER BODILY BY INSERCLING HER WASTE WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHY HE WANTED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED IT TO THE WITHDRAWER OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLET OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THERE SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TOLD AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMEBODY TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT REVERENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRAWING HIS PLAY THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY RAPS AND SOME STIPLES FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MATE SEVENT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S DREAMMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPING MY GIRL SAID HYACINTH
1255-90407-0028 HE A GAME BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH TO BE INITIATE TO JOIN THE BOOK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WHERE OF THIS ATTARE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT IT LOVE IS CARRA
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS PLACE AND SACRIFICE
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE DAVID'S EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FATAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FULL'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS IS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT VOUS HE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GET FARTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALLAMETATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE DID NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTON SURE SQUARE AND HE WENT THOUGH WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIDY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO HONESTLY COST HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE WENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SEARCHING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUSTICE THEY TURN MEDEERRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SAID THIS OLD EER HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTOR AND TWISTED ABOUT EM PUT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DATY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH BE NEARLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SAT IN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE WANINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE RESOLVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DIDN'T YOU FEEL THEY MEAN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MOMENTS IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNSIVAL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT THEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY ART AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNEL CLIFFS ALL THE NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSEPH AND PHSTON
1255-90413-0019 OH DIDN'T YOU MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE NEIGHBOUR WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JUSTIN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WOOD'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY HARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAND LIGHT NICKLE UPON AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE LAST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS HE OF THE GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE PANTA EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE A ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY OF JUSTICE LEFT WIFE OF A LAW TO JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTSIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMAN AND WAS CONSENTING HIS SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JUSTLY TO RECOMMEND HIS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLAINNESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOE RAINING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENS THE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THE ENTERS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING ON HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE THAT IT IS FRIGHTFUL COST A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS A CHIEF THE ADVENTURE MAKES ITS THE PAIR ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY A MATERIAL ARE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN THE WEIGHTS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT DISMISS THE APPARAGES A FORBID IS VERY USED
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY ARE INATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWING THE INVENTION THE SEEKING THE HIGH GOOD KNIT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TROUBLE TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD OF HER FACTION IF CONCYVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTRY PART AND INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A HOE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ECEPTIONS HAPPEN LESS FAST
1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGA OF THE ELECTRY ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF APPARENT ARCHLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY VOCCAMIS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO THING UNDER FRENCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGLOSIDIC CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINENING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CURIOUS MANNER THE MONARD OF ELECTRILYING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST HIS SELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL CAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ATTICING STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY A MONSIEUR THAT ON TO THESE CONDITIONS THE MAUD LINING HUMP IS SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCONESCENT AND ARTLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SHORES OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAPPY CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATTIC AND MINING COMPASS IN THE LEADING CITIZEN
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDEST GROUP
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST PURE FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCHIED BUT IT INTERFERRED ONLY WITH HIS TREAT SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HAS LARGE A SOURCE OF INCOME BY ENEMIES
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALL WAS CURIOUS WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ENEMIES
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOT UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT IS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HAUNTERS OF CITIES THEY LET TRICK AND GAS PROMISE ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSHING THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINENCE
1585-131718-0018 A MOST CONSPIIGUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THE NEW YORK HIMSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WERE ASPLENDY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER IN ISSUES NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE UDO
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GRAY MANY COUNTS WERE EATEN AND RAT BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREY BARK AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DIM AND THE BALLAST OF WATERGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WOULD SEW THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TWO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY AT IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUGHT A VERY GREAT SHAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 HAD THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORD NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE DONE IT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO MEDICINE THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HERISON AND EMPORING THE CHINESE TRADER WHEN TO HIM INCH WANTED AS DINAMO TO BE RUN BY HEN POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DINAMMOST ADDISONS APPEARED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROSE I WERE SON GO WHERE SWEET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SECMUND BERDMAN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADAMSON UNTELLA FROM THE PARADISON FOONGRAPHS ANNE WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL IT IS THIS MORE WAY IN A LOFT YOUNG LUSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS A SCIENCE HAS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES ATTERS FIFTY FUSES NUMEROUS OUT OF THE EAT HOUSE
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE ATASON ELECTURE LIGHT COMPANY LEAST A OD BEESCHA A MARTIAN AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW RIMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND HIS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMINENTER SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESTINSHIRE AVENUE TO COME WORSE
1585-131718-0033 THEY EXPERIENCED WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS FATHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WHEN DONE TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOOD EXPLORING A RENT
1585-131718-0035 THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEAR SIX IF I WAS A VERITABLE B HIGH DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY BEING ITS ARDENTACLET OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING THE GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM OUT IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER AN EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRECY AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MOTOR
1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TO BUSY HER OTHER THINGS TO DEN NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDIZAN SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREY VIOLINIST WAS RAMINEY
1585-131718-0044 WHO WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS FILLING
1585-131718-0045 WHY NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS FIRING ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL HIS SIXTY FIVE LATE IN NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HAT OF LONDON FIBRY GATE
1585-131718-0048 WHO GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLEST STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORY'S AT THE HAIRS IN THEM FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING

1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF INTEREST AND DISSIPATION AND THE POWERLESS PLEASURE OF FACTING ELLISON'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE DISPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED

1585-157660-0005 THE DEVILS HEAVEN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS FOURS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNYED COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WELCOME AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIDE BOTTOMS LAYING IF IN FOING ARMS AND MORPHORUS UNTO THE POT OF KNOCK AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE

1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH A LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BOO PERHAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPATIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JOPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WELCOME COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RCIPROCO
1585-157660-0015 THE PRINTING SHOP OF FOUL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL WAS TABLE AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES ROBERGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORMER WILLIAM AND BLURRY OUT IN HIS GLOVE MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY REASON TRAVELLERS IN THE BEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN PAW IN THE HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE VAST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT THE MUTILATED MOST CHEERED OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMOTIONAL AND POLITICAL TREADMAN
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLEEVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS MORES TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BID ITS MORES ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRESS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSE US A SMART RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY REQUIRED A TRUE LAUGH OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT APIC OF THE CELL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHAPARDA GIVES US A UNTOFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FOR OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 THEN THE AGE OF THE BUUDRE CAME HUMANITY WAS CHARGED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS OUTEMMO'S DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HOUNDENED INTO AN AGE OF INNOTE CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED A ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER MIGHT BE NEXT TROUBLE LAW OF EXPLOSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS IT BEEN QUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURALLY AND A AND HARM ME WITH THOSE VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 MY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GREAT OF AN INALASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HELDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LULLS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A PALMAN AND PACIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOMENTING CIRCUMSTANCES TO BEAR AN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MOSTRING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING US CHIEFS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY INNO NO ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND A FIGHTING AND FREEDOM SCHOOLS
1630-102884-0016 EACH HAD PRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF THE NOTION WHICH HAS TO A PUREANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUE AND THEREFORE GIVES RICE TO SLAVERY THOUGH WITH TEN ITS BOUND FREECE AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE PLANTS IN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAG STAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLGONSKY BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND JI LIKE MOON

1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE EYE CON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE TO KNOW THAT TO SEEK WHO HAVE IN THIS LIFE AND OUGHT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GLOOM
