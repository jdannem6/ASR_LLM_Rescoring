116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE AND FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY THITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREY CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO ATTEND HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLIGHTING TO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GLAD
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CAN LOOK THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AND I'DOL I WHISPERED TAKE HIM BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPED GOD THEY DID NOT EXISTENCE
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAM REMAINED MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDLE MEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE AHENS A SEA OF LIGHT HE CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT ENTROOPED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS WANTS WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 PRODUCE THEM
116-288045-0015 I WISHED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASS FOR ME
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNED THE DIVINEAPOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HOMR
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HAMMER THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO APOLLO IS NOT AN IDLE
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF OUR GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN AND GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THEIR VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND A MEAN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME A SIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT A PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH HIS EDUCATION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN EVIL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE A SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWER INTO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WOULD TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL HE MIGHT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 MAY HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEN TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTUR TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE USE AS MUCH OF AN IDLE AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHILE WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TROOP TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPENING AND CAN A DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLENITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER TO LIVE FOR A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DAGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILT UP IS IN OTHER CHRISTIAN ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OF PRINCE IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPERING TRUTH AND A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF A STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRIINNEL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS FORWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TWENTY WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH TO SEE YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 THE FIRST LESS BE IMPERSONAL METHOD'S IRREVERENT BLASSUMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG IN A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM IN B
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOUR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH A SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WHEN IN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST AND MAY BUT THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE WOULD CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 AMID HIS A ESSENTIAL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAZ WERE KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASK QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN IMPORTANT DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSING OFF TO STOP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS NICHOLAS THE BROOMED HIM MAN WAS SATISFIED AND HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED HIS INADEQUASY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN IN INDIA HAS IN REPLACE BY ACTIVE INFORMATION CONCERN THE INDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS OF IT
116-288047-0007 THERE IS THE MAN OF FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS IN IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES OF BE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURB IN ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RHYTHMLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FEEL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FERRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE IN AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 ABOVE AT THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET NOT REALLY BEING TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNDER WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENTIST WAS NOT BORN TILL MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN NOT PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WHIM OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FACE AND MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL WAS THE BAR FACE AS SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SILENCE OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF HIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTH PEACE AND NO ONE MAY DISAPPEAR WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS BEING REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HAND OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WOULD DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COST IN THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO JOINED TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED WITH A CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF VARIOUS TIMES AS A BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GUS WAS GIVEN NO DATE AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORE ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 MIGHT AS DESCRIPTIONCY IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARIAN JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED TO EGYPT LUC SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HARD FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COUNT THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH QUICKER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHY IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUSIFIXION IS COMMEMERATED THE WEAK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VERY FREE OF A YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUALNESS AS THE FULL MOON LAUGHS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAG AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSAIA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 THAT IN THE ACTIONS OF EVIDENCE ORGAN OFFERS A FALLING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS FYPICAL SENSEES ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEARED TO BE ON THE ANOTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW IT WAS LARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER DUUS AND MERRY
116-288048-0013 THERE ISN ACTUALLY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCUMENT HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYNTH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE SHE SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS I KEEP BY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN HOW THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF THIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAD BEEN IN THAT CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOWLESS IS HIS UNANIMOUS SONS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE INNUMEROUS CANIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE HE IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BUT A SWORD NOW AND BY HILL FAR HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUVE'S MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GARMENT LEVERS TO QUARTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO ROME
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS WOMEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MUCH SELF TO LIVE OFFICE THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 OR WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH A PREACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS RE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YOU ASKED ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT KNOW JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A ROOMY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES CYNICLESSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FROM AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO ITS CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR IMMEDIATE OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BUSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FULL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WOOL AND OF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMYER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLAUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTERWARD A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY OBSERVABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THE SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WAS THINKING ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 TO THREE
1255-138279-0009 FULLY FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT TWELVE A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SOME MOREA
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MOSSIL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SOUGHT WHICH RACES MIDLAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY SMALL WELL POLE
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW STRUCK A GAME IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THAT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE ENEMY OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLOOD SPOT IN THE SNOW CREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I HOPE WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 WHEN I SAY THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 WHY MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 AND I HAVE MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO YOU WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO CAUSE I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO TASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NAE FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 MEANS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WHY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED SAID THE KNIGHT WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WHY WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BAIKED FOR SOME TO DAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATCH THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE THAT HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 YET THEY WILL PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT AT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 POTATO RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAD HE LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARDS TO HIS PLANT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LEVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 NOW PULLS ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MARRIED IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TROUBLED FROM ONE PAUL VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRIES IN FAVOR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BOTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOR MISTER AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THE MONSTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO MAKE YOUR LEGISERATIVE THAN ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER FATE SOME THAT WILL PROBABLY BOIL EVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HAVE FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU READY WISHED IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN AH ASKED ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT AN EARLY IN THE MORNING

1255-90407-0020 HE SEATED HER BODILY BY INSIRCLING HER WASTE WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHY HE WONDER AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS OLD AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANTS TO DO THIS AND SENT YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT REVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRY HIS PLAY THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY RAPS AND SOME STIPLES FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MATE SEVENT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ALMFUL OF WOMAN'S DREAMMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE ASLEEP MY GIRL SAID PEASANT

1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE DAVID'S EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT PART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FULL'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 THE THIS WAS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT VOUSSELLABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FARTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPOSITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALL MEATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE DID NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTON SHALL SQUARE AND HE WENT THOUGH WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIDY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO UNLESS THEY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE WENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SUITKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS

1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER ONIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT DEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY ARCH AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM A LADY TEMPLE CLIFFS ALL THE NIGHT

1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMAL WORKMAN AND WAS CONCERNING HIS SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JUSTLIN TO RECOMMEND HIS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVENING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENS THE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WHALE OF THEM ENTERS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING OF HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE THAT IT IS FRESH FOR COST A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS A CHIEF THE INVENTION MAKES ITS A PAIR ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY A MATERIAL ARE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT DISMISSED THE APPARAGES A FORBID IS VERY USED
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR INATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWING THE INVENTION THE SEEKING THE HIGH GOOD KNIT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD OF HER FACTION IF CONCYVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY SALUTRY PART AND INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A HOE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ECEPTIONS HAPPILY LEFT FAST
1585-131718-0007 YES THE VERY VOGO OF THE ELECTRY ARTLIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF APPARENT ARCLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMNESS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRENCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGLOSIDIC CONTRACTS FROM STREET LINENING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CURIOUS MANNER THE MONARD OF ELECTRILYING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST HIS SELF WITH INTONS REVERIES AND JEALOUSES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ATTICUM STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY AND ASSUME THAT ON TO THESE CONDITIONS THE MAUD LINING HUMP IS SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCONESCENT AND ARTLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SORES OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PASSED THE RESIDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAPPEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATTICON LINING COMPASS IN THE LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS VENUS GREW
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELINGS WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GASMANAGEER DID NOT LIKE ARCHIED BUT IT INTERFERRED ONLY WITH HIS TREATMENT SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HAS LARGE A SOURCE OF INCOME BY ENEMIES
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINZING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALL WAS CURIOUS WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ANIMOUS
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NO UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT IS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HAUNTERS OF CITIES THEY LEFT WEAK AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSHING THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINENCE
1585-131718-0018 A MOST CONSPIIGIOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THE NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY PROPOSITION OF WHICH THEY ARE WORKS PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER AN ISSUES NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE HE WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GRAY MANY COUNTS WERE READEN AND RAT BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY EPATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT AT AT A GREAT BARK AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DAM IN THE BALLAST AND WATERGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WOULD SOW THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY WITH THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DONE TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY AT IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LAST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CALLED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEWH HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 BUT THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORD NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE DONE IT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO MEDICINE THAT WHILE HE HAD A FACTORY AT HERISON AND EMPORING THE CHINESE TRADER WHEN TO HIM INCH WANTED AS DINAMO TO BE RUN BY HEN POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DINAMMOST ADDISONS APPEARED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROSE I WERE SON GO WERE STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SECMUND BERDMAN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADAMSON UNTELLA FROM THE PARADUSON PHONGRAPHS ANNE WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL IT IS THIS MORE WAY IN A LOFT YOUNG LUSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS A SCIENCE HAS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES ATTERS FIFTY FUSS NUMEROUS OUT OF EAT HOUSE
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE ATASON ELECTURE LIGHT COMPANY LEAST A OD BEESCHA A NATION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEAD QUARTERS AND SHOW RIMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND HIS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMINENTER SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESTLANDSHIRE AVENUE TO COME WORSE
1585-131718-0033 THEY EXPERIENCED WHICH A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS FARTHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOOD EXPLORING A RENT
1585-131718-0035 THE NEXT POOR OR FIVE YEAR SIX IF I WAS A VERITABLE B HIGH DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY BEING ITS ARDONACWOOD OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING THE GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOVED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER AN EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGORS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THAT ROSE OUT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT KNOW MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
1585-131718-0041 AND I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TO BUSY HER OTHER THINGS TO DENOTISE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDIZAN SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GRAVE VIOLINIST WAS RAMINEY
1585-131718-0044 WHO WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS BYLING
1585-131718-0045 WHY NOT HE CAME WITH HIS DARLING ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL HIS SIXTY FIVE LATE A NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HAT OF LONDON IN FIBRY GATE
1585-131718-0048 WHO GO OUT AMONG THE HIGH LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLEST STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN GEORGE AT THE HAIR IS IN THEM FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING

1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF INTEREST AND DISSIPATION AND THE PARENTOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING MEDICINE'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVEXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON IS COAT AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MAN ARE MOTIVE OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE O STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRAYING ROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEORRICO FASHION AND UTTER THE FALLING ARTORICAL FLIGHT
1585-157660-0003 GLAMOURS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SOUND A THING THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT THE VASTAGE OF THIS ONE OF HER MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WOLF BAT AND BEAT HIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE HURT AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDING DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S CABIN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS FLOORS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNYED COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WELL AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIDE BOTTOMS LAYING IF IN FOAMING ARMS AND MORPHORUS UNTO THE POT OF KNOCK AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NIGHT
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIDE OF THE SUN RISINGLAND A GIFT OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXHITATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPECTATION FATED AND MOST OFF THERE WERE MOST A PROMISES AND OFF A HEADS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS
1585-157660-0009 DEUCES ONE DOUBLE WHEN SIX IS TRIPICALLY
1585-157660-0010 WELL INTO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DILLER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CINIPOT WHICH WERE IMMEDIATELY KEPT BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOK AT ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION

1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE UPON THE CAST I WILL STAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FAMILY JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BOO PERHAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JAPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RCIPROCO
1585-157660-0015 THE PRINTING SHOP OF FOUL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL WAS TAKEN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES ROBERT GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORMER WILLIAM AND BLURRY OUT IN HIS GLOVEMANER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY REASON TRAVELLERS IN THE VAST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND IN EFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS LIGHTNING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE BEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVEING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN PART IN THE HANDS
1630-102884-0003 AS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE VAST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT THE MUTILATED MUCH CHEERED OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMOTIONAL AND POLITICAL TREATMENT
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLEEVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS MORES TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BID ITS MORES ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUST FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSE US A MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY QUIET THE TRUE LAUGH OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT APIC OF THE CELL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHAPORETA GIVES US A PLENTIFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FOR OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUUDRE CAME HUMANITY WAS CHARRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS OUTEMMO'S DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HOUNDENED INTO AN AGE IF IN NOTED CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ILLASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED AT ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER MIGHT BE NEXT TROUBLE LAW OF EXPLOSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS IT MANY QUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURALLY AND AH AND HOW MANY WITH THEIR VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 MY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GREAT OF AN INALASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HELDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE ENOED THE LULLS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A PALMAN AND PACIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO BEAR AN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MOSTRING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING US CHAPTERS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY INNO NO ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HURRYING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND A FIGHTING AND FREEDOM SCHOOLS

1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SOME SATISFACTION AND LEISURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD EYECON PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOURITE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY KNOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED WHEN THE LITTLE EYECON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SATURDAY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT SHOULD BE TO KNOW THAT TO SEEK WHO HAVE IN THIS LIFE AND OUGHT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GLOOM
1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SAY LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME

1630-73710-0001 THIS DAY KNEW HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF HOPE
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT THE PICTURE SUCH MISSISSITUDES TO THEIR IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITTS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE SWORD OF DEBT THE SCOURING OR LANIERE FANCIES BUT ITS BAD LIKE WING AND CHANGING BEHELD THE ATMOSPHERE OF HER HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPLANATIONS
